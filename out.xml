<lb />One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a
<lb />bizarre thorn branch, then melt a lb of the most
<lb />beautiful clear pitch resin and put in one ounce of
<lb />subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if
<lb />you add in a little Venice laque platte, the
<lb />color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted
<lb />over a charcoal fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 
<lb />Next dip in your branches while turning, & if any filaments
<lb />should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the
<lb />charcoal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Colophony is nothing other than recooked resin. To do
<lb />it well, take a leaded pot & melt the resin,
<lb />& boil it over the brazier a good hour,
<lb />& until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like
<lb />water, & easily runs & flows from the tip of a
<lb />stick with which you grind it, & test it. Then pour it
<lb />through a coarse canvas or a very light tammy
<lb />cloth, such that when pouring it falls into the
<lb />strongest vinegar that you can find, for the vinegar gives
<lb />it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
<lb />or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For
<lb />counterfeiting your coral, you can mix a quarter part of
<lb />mastic into your purified resin to render it more firm
<lb />and more beautiful, & if you were to take a single tear of
<lb />mastic, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sulfur & vermilion makes the same effect.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The coral made of gules red enamel endures the
<lb />file and polishing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is made like cement that is stronger mixed with pestled
<lb /><-than of-> glass rather than with brick. Thus, here one
<lb />mixes well pestled gules red enamel, which
<lb />is red in body, with the vermilion. Thus with all colors of
<lb />enamels.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish for panels
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a lb of Venice turpentine & heat
<lb />it in a pot until it simmers, and put in half a lb of
<lb />the turpentine oil of the whitest you can find, and stir it
<lb />together well on a charcoal fire and take it off immediately. And
<lb /><-elle-> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
<lb />add in a little more oil. Similarly if it is too clear, you can
<lb />thicken it by putting in a little turpentine. Thus you will give it
<lb />whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
<lb />heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
<lb />and other painted things without corrupting the colors or yellowing. And
<lb />it dries both in the shade and in the sun, and
<lb />overnight, and during the winter as well as
<lb />in the summer. It is commonly sold 15 sous a
<lb />lb.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />A little more turpentine than turpentine oil is needed in
<lb />order to give body to the varnish, which needs to be applied with
<lb />the finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
<lb />for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
<lb />varnish to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
<lb />of them.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Thick varnish for planks
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />There is a varnish that takes a long time to dry &
<lb />drips more than two months after it has been applied to the
<lb />planks. But this one does not drip like that of times
<lb />past, which was made of linseed oil, garlic boiled in it
<lb />to extinguish it & rid it of grease, 
<lb />& with wheat. And this one yellowed &
<lb />rendered greenish the blue color of paintings. This one is made like the
<lb />other one except that one puts coarse common turpentine
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />    
<lb />But it is used to heighten colors which have soaked in and to keep them
<lb />from dust. Mastic varnish does not resist rain,
<lb />whereas that of oil and rosin does.

<lb />instead of fine turpentine. And you can put into two
<lb />lb of <-tou-> common turpentine one lb
<lb />of fine turpentine oil & do everything as with the other one. This one
<lb />will cost you no more than five or six sous per
<lb />lb & is sold for 40 sous per
<lb />lb.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This vessel is for making large quantities of
<lb />turpentine oil, that is to say a bucket an
<lb />hour, and no matter which turpentine it may be,
<lb />whether fine or crude. One needs to give, as you know, a little
<lb />fire at the beginning and always keep cold water in the cooler
<lb />on the top. The lb is sold at xii sous, &
<lb />at the bottom of the vessel remains the colophony, or
<lb />pix græca. In this vessel, eau-de-vie is also made well,
<lb />and there is no need to distill it again. You
<lb />do not need a oven for this copper vessel, but
<lb />only charcoal around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
<lb />round, you will place it on a trivet.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> It is better to heat the varnish a little bit, rather than to
<lb />put it out in the sun, because this makes the panel
<lb />warp.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Some say it is not good to distil in this copper
<lb />vessel because it makes things green. However, when tinned, it is
<lb />good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For varnishing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it
<lb />is fatty & viscous & it is not absorbed in the wood like that
<lb />of spike lavender & sandarac. Also, that of spike
<lb />lavender does not require any glue on iron &
<lb />similar things that do not absorb. But on wood & on colors
<lb />which <-have-> do not have gum or 
<lb />distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<lb />hide glue & to let it dry & to
<lb />varnish.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f006" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish of spike lavender oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to heat spike lavender oil & as it begins to
<lb />simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum so that it soon melts. And
<lb />over a charcoal fire stir continuously until the sandarac
<lb />is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<lb />varnish on a plate, and if it is fatty when you handle
<lb />it with a finger, it is ready. And for one lb
<lb />of spike lavender oil, you will put five ounces of
<lb />pulverized sandarac, although some only put in four
<lb />ounces, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
<lb />promptly dry. Frame makers, to avoid the trouble of polishing
<lb />their ebony, varnish it with this, as do guitar makers.
<lb />This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine,
<lb />though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
<lb />varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish was in use,
<lb />because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<lb />turpentine, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
<lb />pulverized mastic extracted in tears or otherwise, & it will be
<lb />more desiccative, in place of sandarac.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to varnish on plaster or a wall, first put on
<lb />your very hot hide glue, because if were cold it
<lb />would not penetrate the wall, & when you would put your
<lb />varnish on, it would come off.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish of spike lavender oil is not as appropriate for colors as
<lb />that of turpentine, for spike lavender oil <-makes them
<lb />die-> eats the colors since it is too
<lb />penetrating.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For removing varnish from an old panel that is yellowish &
<lb />varnishing it anew
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take white soap & sieved ashes<-e->, &
<lb />soak both in water. And with a sponge, take the said
<lb />ashes & soap & rub the panel with them. And as you
<lb />see that the old varnish is removed, throw a
<lb />bucket of water against the panel to clean it.
<lb />Next put it for a quarter of an hour in the
<lb />sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
<lb />is dry, you can spread your turpentine varnish on it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make sure the colors do not come off.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut
<lb />oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &
<lb /><-onions-> +hog’s
<lb />fennel, some also add bread crusts, which you will
<lb />boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put
<lb />in one lb of the oil thus boiled the size of a walnut of black
<lb />pitch & a double handful of grains of wheat, without
<lb />removing the garlic & onions, and let
<lb />it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And
<lb />when the pitch is well melted & when the oil has body,
<lb />you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
<lb />iron over a low charcoal fire & apply your
<lb />varnish with a feather or a brush.
<lb />And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
<lb />varnish is dry.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster
<lb />beads of jet among the rest.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some consider walnut oil better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least
<lb />half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It
<lb />is dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and is
<lb />hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an
<lb />open space.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb
<lb />of galipot, which costs 4 sous, & some
<lb />peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of
<lb />itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.

<lb />Take linseed oil or walnut oil
<lb />&, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little

<lb />Steel mirrors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />X They are called of steel because in times
<lb />past they were commonly made of steel polished with
<lb />emery putty. But more easily, various kinds are made
<lb />with cuivre franc, which is rosette &
<lb />tin, because it is cast in a mold & made
<lb />round, concave, convex & however one likes, to represent various
<lb />forms.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />So take half rosette copper & half
<lb />soft tin, that is to say fine, which has not yet been used.
<lb />Put them in a crucible, & first melt the copper
<lb />well. And once it is well melted, put in the tin and mix
<lb />together. Then cast in the mold, of white stone with no
<lb />eyelets, & anoint the mold with oil, & let
<lb />it be moderately warm. Then, having
<lb />molded your mirror, you can polish it in this way.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Set one of these in plaster in order that it holds firmly,
<lb />& then put the other one over it with thin sand in between,
<lb />& rub one against the other, whether it be concave or flat, & thus you
<lb />will polish two at once. And if you want to polish them on both sides,
<lb />you only need to switch them, that is to say put the one that was
<lb />polishing into the plaster & the one that was in the
<lb />plaster to polish. After having polished them with the
<lb />arene you can smooth them with Venice tripoli, 
<lb />which should not be sandy, & next with
<lb />putty. You polish with
<lb />arene using water, but polishing with
<lb />tripoli & putty is done
<lb />dry. Once polished, you can set it.

<ab>
<lb />Concave mirrors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The concave mirror composed in the aforesaid form produces an
<lb />endless number of pretty conceits which seem magic. If someone wants to see
<lb />oneself from behind, it is necessary to place the concave
<lb />mirror on the ground on its foot, & let it be at a slant;
<lb />next, look at it from one pace away. But if you
<lb />look at it close up, it will represent you the right way up but
<lb />with your face quite large & the hairs of your
<lb />beard as thick as
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f009" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />string & will represent a nipple as large as a plate, and
<lb />women can see the secret places that they do not
<lb />want to show to surgeons. It casts the representation out of
<lb />itself, and if you touch <-the place-> the eye of
<lb />the representation with your finger, another finger
<lb />will come against yours.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You will make a light at night for someone quite far
<lb />away, if you place the concave mirror behind a candle
<lb />placed on the window. You will be able to read and write quite
<lb />far from the candle if you place it behind the candle
<lb />& place & turn the concavity toward you. If you put
<lb />the mirror at the end of a table & a
<lb />candle on it, it will represent two lights on the
<lb />table for you. To see what is happening on a street,
<lb />shutter the window, whereby the more of it you can shut the
<lb />better it will be. Make a hole at the lower one, as wide as your little
<lb />finger, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
<lb />place a sheet of paper on the window
<lb />& let the middle of the sheet be over the hole.
<lb />Pierce the sheet in the same place as the hole & the same
<lb />size. After, place the concave face of the mirror toward the
<lb />hole, & it will represent to you all those who pass by in the
<lb />street on the sheet of paper. Similarly with
<lb />the pierced door of a closed room. You can make wavy ones
<lb />& triangular ones, in the fashion that Ptolemy describes, &
<lb />Archimedes. The concave one also sets fire to straw from
<lb />quite far away, and lights a candle with the sun. Also, 
<lb />it heats through the reverberation of fire.

<lb />ash. <-Grind-> Wash it quite well in clean water.
<lb />Next, grind it on marble & temper it with water of
<lb /><-ret-> hide glue. Next, apply to
<lb />your wooden candlesticks & any other work you like,
<lb />& burnish with the tooth. You can grind pin filings
<lb />& apply them with the said glue.

<lb />For laying down and seating burnished gold and giving red

<ab>
<lb />Ceruse & lead white is not appropriate for polished
<lb />white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
<lb />or mat which is made with oil, mixing it with yellow
<lb />ocher & mine <-po-> & tempering
<lb />all of it with oil. And this or mat thus applied keeps
<lb />in the rain like gilded lead work & similar things.
<lb />Therefore for burnished gold take good chalk, quite white,
<lb />well ground, & tempered with distemper glue, & make
<lb />four layers of it, one after the other, on the wood. And once the
<lb />last is dry, rub it with prele, which is a
<lb />plant otherwise called horsetail, to render it well
<lb />polished. Next take fine boli armeni &
<lb />sanguine, as much of one as of the other, also lamb
<lb />tallow the size of a bean or a
<lb />pea depending on the quantity of bole, and a
<lb />little willow charcoal, or as much as the
<lb />tallow, & half a walnut shell full of
<lb />half-burned saffron. Some put in a little candy
<lb />sugar. Grind all together with water, & apply it without
<lb />gum or glue, & let it dry, & rub the place that
<lb />you want to gild with a piece of white cloth to better
<lb />smooth it, & when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
<lb />the gold will be carried well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
<lb />paintbrush soaked in clear water the place that
<lb />you want to gild & immediately apply the gold, which you will
<lb />burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in rouge clair
<lb />& glaze with it <-de->, grind Venice
<lb /> laque platte on marble with
<lb />walnut or linseed oil. Once ground, mix

<lb />green, temper verdigris with walnut or
<lb />linseed oil & grind it, next mix in turpentine varnish
<lb />and not spike lavender varnish, which is not suitable for

<lb />You can embellish them with enamel cannules of

<lb />cannules. These you will break neatly to the length that you
<lb />want if you slightly notch with a cutting file the place to
<lb />be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
<lb />them with a wood model over a
<lb />chafing-dish or else by the heat of the lamp. It can
<lb />also be drawn as long as you want in a small furnace made like
<lb />a reverberatory furnace but which is pierced on both sides. And
<lb />when the large cannule is red, they seize the hot end using
<lb />small pincers with a long beak, such that one prong of the beak
<lb />of the small pincers enters inside the end of the 
<lb />cannule, & thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &
<lb />the other end of the cannule is held with the hand,
<lb />because it is not hot. When the cannule is stretched enough,
<lb />the one who works seated, having his furnace
<lb />the size of a carnation pot before him,
<lb />breaks it off & continues. This is for making

<lb />Once you have <-gilded-> colored, make your

<lb />white, massicot & mine de plomb
<lb /><-[illegible]->, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
<lb />Minium gives color to the gold. Next, with this, you make
<lb />a layer of it evenly on your stamping, taking care not to fill the hollows.
<lb />And once it is almost dry, lay the gold leaf on it with
<lb />cotton. Such gold will hold up in the rain on
<lb />houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with tinsel, color
<lb />it with smoke of partridge or of yellow or red
<lb />cloth, & it will be beautiful like fine gold. You can
<lb />cover trunks, mirrors, valences & bedposts with colored

<lb />Take horn from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, &
<lb />underneath make the figure of your jasper, cornalines,

<lb />& fatty polish like jasper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You know how, with scrapings of the said horn, 
<lb />roses can be imitated. The <-horn-> colors for
<lb />this jasper want to have a base with clear turpentine or
<lb />spike lavender varnish. And colors matte in body
<lb />are not so appropriate here, although they are very beautiful. One
<lb />needs to oil the unpainted reverse with spike
<lb />lavender oil.

<lb />You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the

<lb />joints. One needs to join them with gum ammoniac soaked in
<lb />vinegar. To better counterfeit mottled jasper, apply
<lb />wool with thick hairs dyed in diverse colors & intermingled.
<lb />After you have layered all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them,
<lb />then layer gold & silver leaf. If you layer on the
<lb />horn colors of turpentine, give it a base of silver
<lb />or of tin leaf. You can also file horn & mix

<lb />immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an
<lb />iron until the lead and salt are well
<lb />incorporated, and lift it immediately from the fire, stirring
<lb />continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on
<lb />marble and pass it through a fine sieve. Then

<lb />For painting in oil on taffeta without the

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made
<lb /><-of well-cooked honey & turpentine-> of strong glue 
<lb />soaked for 24 hours in water then gently
<lb />brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
<lb />honey to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top
<lb />of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
<lb />oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
<lb />serve you to make a seat for gold. Alum water also

<lb />Painting esmail d’azur in oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters.
<lb />Some take the most delicate they can & grind it with ceruse,
<lb />which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places
<lb />the area they want to paint with azur d’esmail, in order that the
<lb />oil enters & leaks in, & does not
<lb />cause the azure, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the
<lb />panel flat & put down the azure on it, which is also done
<lb />in distemper. The main thing is to grind it well on
<lb />marble, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly.
<lb />Some grind it <-with-> thoroughly with an egg yolk &
<lb />then wash it in five or six waters and lay it
<lb />on not with a paintbrush, which would be too soft, but
<lb />with a brush thoroughly softened & crimped,
<lb />& layering it thickly as if one were putting it down with a
<lb />trowel; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have
<lb />experienced that grinding azur d’esmail with egg
<lb />yolk & next washing it in several waters is
<lb />good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it.
<lb />I have also washed it in several waters &, when it
<lb />had settled a little, I removed the water, still
<lb /><-q-> blue, with a sponge and squeezed it into another
<lb />vessel <-thus-> where it settled, & from the
<lb />residue I had the ash, flower, and subtlest part of the
<lb />azure without grinding it, which is
<lb />the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those
<lb />who make it in Germany compound it like enamel, in large
<lb />pieces which they pestle, & pass through several sieves
<lb />& wash.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a
<lb />rock water, as they call it; it is a
<lb />water distilled from mines where azure or vert
<lb />d’azur is found, which distills naturally through the
<lb />veins of the mountain or is distilled through an
<lb />alembic <-par-> from mineral stones of
<lb />azure or copper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure ashes are only good for landscapes because
<lb />they die in oil. Only true azure holds on. Azur
<lb />d’esmail cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on
<lb />the fingernail or the oil palette. If
<lb />it <-[illegible]-> happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with
<lb />the egg yolk or, better yet, wash it in clear
<lb />water & with a sponge remove the colored
<lb />water after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner
<lb />you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work
<lb />with.

<lb />them with <-diamond-> pumice stone powder. One
<lb />needs also to unpolish on a lead wheel either the
<lb />stone or the glass on which you want to engrave, for the
<lb />polish, which is like varnish on glass, prevents the
<lb />diamond or sapphire from biting well. <-But-> This
<lb />is why it does not bite easily on the nail, which is
<lb />polished & fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
<lb />easily.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For molding sulfur
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sulfur is made beautiful mixed with soot black or with
<lb />pulverized sanguine, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
<lb />let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like oil, mix it with
<lb />verdigris, and you <-m-> will very neatly cast in
<lb />plaster a lizard or something else.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to cast unless it is well cooled & unless it
<lb />has lost all its pustules & bubbles, and has settled down
<lb />well & become smooth like <-[illegible]-> water. The
<lb />soot black gives it a fine sheen & makes it neater. The most
<lb />beautiful yellow sulfur must be used, for the greyish &
<lb />lively one is not good. Do not cast in wind &
<lb />in cold, for it would become porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Chimolée
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The terre chimolée, otherwise known as
<lb />fuller’s earth, with which they dress the
<lb />cloth, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; & if you
<lb />want to reheat it, it must first be warm, & reheat it on a gentle
<lb />fire at a distance & little by little, otherwise it would crack.
<lb />Put the figure to reheat in a pot in an oven or in a
<lb />covered oven. It is very soft, neat & beautiful. You
<lb />can make a hollow form of animals from chimolée & cast
<lb />lead in it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 days before you reheat
<lb />it. When you mold & make a hollow form from chimolée, do
<lb />not press suddenly, but gently, for it would crack.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Paper
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The whitest & finest is the best. And when the hollow form is quite
<lb />clean, as of sulfur or cooked chimolée, it is made
<lb />very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of white with a
<lb />border of gold to imitate alabaster. And after you have
<lb />applied the white, you can burnish it with the tooth.
<lb />But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to temper the lead
<lb />white with glair of egg & peelings from the fig
<lb />tree. Or better, varnish your work with white varnish.
<lb />Also, when you are molding with paper, as it starts to dry,
<lb />burnish from the back with the tooth.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />That from the mountains is greyer, and <-the-> the
<lb />one from the region of Albi is whiter. It must be cooked with a
<lb />closed fire, such as a reverberatory furnace or barbers'
<lb />ovens. And the most freshly cooked is the best to put to use.
<lb />One needs to finely grind it on marble. After having prepared your
<lb />hollow form from sulfur or something else, & having oiled it
<lb />& enclosed it in a circle, temper not too
<lb />thickly your plaster with water, & separate it well
<lb />with your finger, and if it makes pustules, throw on top
<lb />more powder of the said plaster & <-[illegible]-> grind it
<lb />with the finger until +
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
<lb />it makes no more pustules. Then cast & sprinkle
<lb />once again with plaster powder & let it take well, then
<lb />scrape the powder.

<ab>
<lb />For whitening enilanroc
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some think that the ceruse-colored crust which is on top
<lb />is natural, others say that it is a secret of ancient lapidaries
<lb />that is lost, others say that it is refired enamel. And by means
<lb />of the said crust, several ciphers, letters, circles
<lb /><-st-> & other bizarre things can be formed. As for
<lb />the method, I have practiced it thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of
<lb />arsenic ground on marble. However, I experimented
<lb />without this, and I put the aforesaid thing, enilanroc, in a
<lb />small iron casket on the fire of my
<lb />goldsmith’s forge with three or four small
<lb />half-burnt charcoals, and blew only with my mouth. And
<lb />nonetheless the thing came to <-redden &-> ignition & turned
<lb />completely white, not only on its surface but also inside, & then I
<lb />let it cool on its own near the fire, for otherwise, exposing
<lb />it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed
<lb />it through my lead <-tin-> wheel, 
<lb />where I found it as hard as before, & uncovering the white
<lb />a little, I found it a fair flesh color. Finally, I polished it &
<lb />saw that it took a very beautiful polish & could paragon a
<lb />very beautiful agate for cutting some beautiful face on it &
<lb />bringing it on <-the-> a table of
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f024" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />agate of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
<lb />respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
<lb />leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made an opening in
<lb />a brick of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then
<lb />I reddened two glassworkers’
<lb />solders, & as they were red, I
<lb />presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
<lb />had the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
<lb />wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a diamond
<lb />point, and I polished it with small hog bristle brushes
<lb />and tripoli. I do not know if it would be better to
<lb />reheat it under hot ashes, & if it would be good to encase it
<lb />in alabaster, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
<lb />brick.

<ab>
<lb />Flesh color from arsenic
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white one that is
<lb />sold as stone, when ground on marble, mixed with
<lb />vermilion or lake or minium, makes a beautiful
<lb />flesh color that is always shiny. Yellow arsenic has a very
<lb />beautiful color, the white one is good in oil and agrees well
<lb />with the lake.

<lb />Fine sieves of raw silk

<lb />One makes tammy of raw silk on a loom, to make

<lb />For knowing the good cendrée of azure for oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The one that accumulates in small clods and is lumpy is

<lb />pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain
<lb />sophisticators mix them, but you will know this if you pour
<lb />some onto a piece of paper & press it & spread it with
<lb />the finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found
<lb />variegated & as if striped with a pale one & a darker one, but if it is
<lb />unmixed it will be even & of one color.

<lb />For walls of earth and rustic construction
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Swallows have taught us this craft, making their nests out
<lb />of mud mixed with wisps & stalks of hay or
<lb />straw to make it bond. Therefore, in places where stone &
<lb />brick are lacking, one can use earth to make partitions
<lb />& walls. And for this, light earth, which does not
<lb />form clumps when plowed, but which is as if intermixed with
<lb />arene, holds first rank, because it can be beaten &
<lb />tamped down better. It is true that one needs to moisten it &
<lb /><-la-> cut it into the shape of sods with a ditch-spade, and
<lb />thus place & arrange it. This one lasts longer and there is not as much
<lb />construction work, and <-not-> dryness does not make it
<lb />crack & split. But, because such kinds of earth are not found
<lb />everywhere, those who are on good & fertile land, after
<lb />marking out with a measuring line the width & length of
<lb />their foundations, drive <-into the ground-> in along the edges, 
<lb />on this side & that, long <-ch-> poles
<lb /><-&-> or chevron beams to support boards
<lb />between which they throw the earth, making each
<lb />layer one foot thick or thereabouts, intermixing it
<lb />as if S.S.S with branches of heather or
<lb />similar things, then with beaters of three
<lb />different forms they tamp it & beat it. One is called the
<lb />mallet, which has a triangular form like A, and with this, one
<lb />first tamps the earth. Next one uses one which is made of blocks of
<lb />wood pointed at the tip & helved to a large stick, & this one
<lb />is for pressing the earth well at the extremities and edges of
<lb />the wall, which adhere to the boards, & is
<lb />called.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The other one is called the
<lb />bat, which is for flattening & beating the earth for
<lb />the last time, as shown in .C. Then one makes another layer of
<lb />earth & heather and beats it as
<lb />was said, & continues thus until the wall is complete,
<lb />which one covers with heather & then with
<lb />earth. Some <-m-> intermix rows of bricks
<lb />in the said wall. They also make the
<lb />wall tapering, giving <-a-> width to the
<lb />foundations according to how high one wants to raise the
<lb />wall. Which, when old, whitens, & thereby shows that it
<lb />has saltpeter in it. That is why, when they fall down,
<lb />gunpowder makers profit from them.

<lb />You can damask a cloth with two different colors and imitate
<lb />embroidery without adding anything to it, in this way. Once it is
<lb />dyed yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
<lb />Then you will baste some string or a thicker cord onto the
<lb />pouncing and thrust it into a dye of guesde woad
<lb />or pastel woad & it will become green, except that
<lb />which is beneath<-us-> the string, which will remain yellow because the
<lb />green dye will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
<lb />with other colors, and instead of cord or string, add some
<lb />pieces of paltry cloth, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
<lb />first color<-s->. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.

<ab>
<lb />Foundry casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One casts candlesticks and small works in a frame with
<lb />sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
<lb />flour in order to make the <-e metal->
<lb />copper or latten run better. When the sand has been used
<lb />for a month, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
<lb />that was used, being reheated <-in fire->
<lb />+, dries out & loses its bond. However,
<lb />it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
<lb />One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar things in
<lb />earth, & copper cast in earth makes less of a
<lb />crust, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
<lb />earth is sandy clay mixed with horse dung
<lb />& cloth waste. That which <-is-> has been used for
<lb />founding, which is black, cooked & as if burnt, is
<lb /><-cast-> mixed with artificial sand, & is
<lb />very good. / To soften & make the copper run, throw in,

<lb />Founding of soft iron
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Most people consider that iron, once melted,
<lb />cannot be melted again because they only heat it in small
<lb />forges, in which it only becomes red-hot. Alchemists
<lb />undertake to melt it mixed with realgar or lead or orpiment. 
<lb />But without all that, some have found a manner of
<lb /><-the-> melting not only brittle iron, such as the kind used
<lb />for iron pots, but also soft iron such
<lb />as <-d-> that of pigs & ingots, which is the most
<lb />difficult kind. And to this effect they make a furnace in this
<lb />manner which has a width of one pan & a half &
<lb /><-one pan & a half of-> a depth of two
<lb />pans. And the blast-pipe, which is the barrel
<lb /><-through-> marked A through which the bellows’ pipes enter, has
<lb />to be placed in the middle of the height of the furnace such
<lb />that there is one pan of the mouth of the
<lb />furnace above the blast-pipe & one
<lb />pan underneath.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Each pan of the mouth of the square furnace
<lb />contains one & a half quintal, & the

<lb />It is also necessary that the blast-pipe enters through to the
<lb />middle of the mouth of the furnace, which is a principal part of
<lb />the secret because the wind will hit the edge & the wall which makes
<lb />up the belly of the furnace & by such means, it spreads
<lb />equally everywhere & above, like the flame in a reverberatory
<lb />furnace, & by such means heats much more; for if the wind were
<lb />to hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
<lb />melted, it would cool it down & prevent it from running &
<lb />melting. It is also necessary for the bellows to be driven by the
<lb />leaping & running of water as in forges, because in
<lb />this manner, the bellows run with measure & compass & with great
<lb />speed, which the strength of workers could <-f-> not
<lb />do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see & the furnace
<lb />on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a channel as
<lb />with other founding, to put the molds of that which you want to
<lb />cast & to do this, you unstop the opening that you had made at the
<lb />bottom of the furnace to make the melted substance run. You
<lb />will be able to melt two quintals of iron each time and
<lb />to do this, you will choose the biggest charcoal you
<lb />can find & put a load of it at the bottom, on the plane and surface
<lb />of the furnace & with the bottom piling up <-as if->
<lb />to a point, up to the top of the wall

<lb />Some make a mold of the caliber of the piece, & temper it,
<lb />then beat a soft iron piece cut to size, & when
<lb />this piece is very red, they beat it into the mold & round
<lb />it off with a large file, considering these balls to be
<lb />stronger than the melted ones which, being brittle, are more subject to

<lb />it is necessary that you have reheated your furnace
<lb /><-with-> with a little of the big charcoal, such that
<lb />the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the aforesaid load of
<lb />charcoals in the middle of which you will put your iron,
<lb />not all at once but ten or fifteen lb each time. And when this
<lb />will be swallowed <-&-> at the bottom of the furnace,
<lb />always put in as much again. And add three or four shovels of
<lb />new charcoal which should be of the biggest kind and remoistened,
<lb />in order that it may have more heat & not be consumed too soon.
<lb />And when you see that your furnace is full of substance, around
<lb />two quintals, or less if you do not [<-of it->] have that much, you will
<lb />leave the charcoal to be consumed by itself. And when the
<lb />charcoal is as it were reduced down to the level of the
<lb />furnace, you will be able to pour into molds &
<lb />iron or metal shells, which is even better
<lb />because one iron attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
<lb />the inside of the mold be well ashed with tempered
<lb />ashes, in order that it does not adhere to it.

<lb />On the gunner

<lb />The cannon fires at point-blank from five to six hundred paces.
<lb />But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
<lb />hundred paces, or three hundred <-paces-> at
<lb />the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball commonly weighs 40
<lb />lb of the King’s caliber. There is
<lb />a cannon-perrier, which weighs xxv quintals, which are
<lb />small, short cannons. It is for fighting the ditch casemates
<lb />& for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
<lb />King’s caliber like the others, namely of
<lb />40 lb. It bears in the breech only the width of two balls
<lb />& a quarter of a ball. The front only bears the width of
<lb />one ball & a third of a ball. Its charge is similar to those of
<lb />bigger ones, namely xx lb. And for this reason, when one wants to try them
<lb /><-[illegible]->, one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
<lb />piece. And for the first time & until it has fired five or six
<lb /><-pieces-> shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
<lb />for the piece is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
<lb />to give it a charge of xx lb of fine arquebus powder
<lb />instead of ordinary cannon powder. And four good horses
<lb />are sufficient to drag them. They are easy, & close up they have as
<lb />much force as the big ones, especially for private houses
<lb />& small towns & fortresses of little
<lb />importance. They are no more subject to bursting than the others
<lb />because they are short. For that which gives great strength to the
<lb />powder & puts the piece in danger of bursting is
<lb />the length of the piece, because the powder is burned entirely
<lb />before exiting, & <-the-> its impetuosity is held constrained
<lb />for longer in a <-small-> long piece than a
<lb /><-gr-> short one. The cannon-perrier is commonly seven to
<lb />eight pans long. It is true that this is a
<lb />pan of Montpellier & not a
<lb />King’s pan, which is not used in the
<lb />founding of cannons for making them good. For the pan of
<lb />Montpellier being <-of-> shorter, the cannons
<lb /><-more-> proportioned there are shorter also, & compensate in
<lb />thickness <-ce-> the length that they would have by the
<lb />King’s pan, by which measure they
<lb />will be found longer. But also they would be thinner. The <-e->

<lb />One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
<lb />greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
<lb />that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of
<lb />rosette. If not, they are only of metal, which
<lb />shows up whitish. If they themselves do not make this demonstration,
<lb />scratch & you will see. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The good alloy for pieces is of three parts of
<lb />rosette & one of the fine metal of
<lb /><-la-> large bells, where there is more
<lb />rosette than in the metal of small bells. The
<lb />metal commonly costs xv lb & fine
<lb />rosette xv or xvi.

<lb />The large cannon, which is for great
<lb />batteries, commonly weighs fifty-five or lx
<lb />quintals. At the breech it carries the thickness of
<lb /><-b-> two balls & one 
<lb /><-l->of the three parts of one ball. At the front, it carries
<lb /><-ba-> the thickness of one ball &
<lb /><-two-> two of the three parts. It is thirteen or fourteen
<lb />pans long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
<lb />head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <-is-> &
<lb />batter with great force, is at <-d-> one-hundred fifty
<lb />paces & at two hundred. <-And-> It is true that one
<lb />batters well from three or 4 hundred paces, but it is necessary
<lb />to give it more powder. Its common load is <-p->
<lb />of xx lb of powder, its ball of 40 lb. One
<lb />needs xxv horses to draw it. When one fires it farther than its
<lb />usual range, one puts in a half ladle of cannon
<lb />powder more. A cannon can fire
<lb />4xx or a hundred shots per
<lb />day, but one needs to refresh it every time after one
<lb />has fired <-di-> nine or ten shots, if the battery is steadily
<lb />continued. For if there is a break, it is not necessary to refresh it as
<lb />often. For two quintals of copper, or two quintals
<lb />& a half if it is for large cannons, one puts one
<lb />quintal of metal. # The
<lb />metal is composed at the beginning of eight lb of
<lb />tin for one quintal of rosette, while
<lb />for large bells one only puts six lb of fine tin for one
<lb />quintal of rosette, to give it a bigger
<lb />voice. For the more tin there is, the clearer the
<lb />sound is. <-Its-> For gun founding, if one provides the
<lb />material & charcoal, as one commonly does, for
<lb />masters do not have the means, one gives x to xii
<lb />lb per quintal. And <-for the mat-> when the
<lb />master provides everything, one gives him 40 lb,
<lb />according to the King’s ordinance, per
<lb />quintal for large pieces <-&-> such as cannons, and for
<lb />small pieces, L lb. For the more material there is,
<lb />the more profit the master has of it. One founds another kind
<lb />of cannon-perriers of xxx quintals which are longer than the
<lb />others, and easily eight pans long, & they are for
<lb />battering defenses & casemates, <-s->
<lb />placing them via trenches on the edge of the ditch

<lb />Large culverins <-are-> for battery & piercing
<lb />are forty quintals & eighteen pans long.
<lb />Their ball, of the King’s caliber & for
<lb />battery, is 30 lb and thus lighter than that of the cannon. And
<lb />thus, it does not carry so much ammunition for fifteen lb
<lb />suffices for its charge. The cannon makes a bigger opening due to the
<lb />size of its ball, but the culverin hits more fiercely & propels
<lb />faster, having greater force due to its length. At the breech it carries
<lb />the thickness of two of its balls & <-es->the 
<lb /><-three-> third part<-s-> of a ball, at the front the
<lb />thickness of one ball & two thirds. Culverins serve to
<lb />batter defenses from afar when one cannot easily make an approach, and
<lb />cannons approach more closely. They also serve to support the battery.
<lb />One needs fifteen or sixteen horses for moving it. They are
<lb /><-tout-> of the same alloy as the cannon, as are all
<lb />pieces <-that exceed-> smaller than average, for to
<lb />these, one adds a little more metal in order that the melt runs
<lb />better. And for two quintals of rosette, one
<lb />adds six twenties lb of metal for the smaller pieces.
<lb />They shoot 8 or 9 hundred paces at point-blank, & up to
<lb />a thousand paces if the powder is strong, &
<lb />half a league at range.

<ab>
<lb />Some invented the loading of cannons with cartouches.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some <-po-> do not put the powder in the cannon
<lb />all in one go but in two & ramming each time, saying that each
<lb />ramming raises & gives a further thumb’s breadth. But this
<lb />is not certain for large pieces which are loaded with a lot of
<lb />powder.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The bastarde, which is a <-culverin->
<lb /><-middle-sized-> piece,
<lb />weighs thirty quintals and its ball weighs <-xx
<lb />lb-> xv lb and carries as its charge x
<lb />or xii lb of powder. Its proportion is at the breech the
<lb />thickness of two of its balls & the<-es->
<lb />th<-ree->ird part<-s-> of a ball. At the front, the
<lb />thickness of a ball & two of three parts. <-or->
<lb />They serve to batter defences of little importance such as
<lb />gabions and garrets topped with a tower &
<lb />similar things. It is thirteen or xiiii pans long like
<lb />the large cannon. Ten horses can move it. It accompanies well
<lb />the large culverin for point-blank because it carries small
<lb />ammunition.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some give it the thickness of three balls at the breech & at the
<lb />front of two balls.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The bastard culverin weighs 35 quintals & is xxv
<lb />pans long. It carries three balls at the breech &
<lb />two in front. Its ball is like that of the bastarde piece,
<lb />weighing xv lb. These are pleasure pieces which <-s-> cannot be moved by
<lb />carriage, but are for city defences. Some make these xxvii or
<lb />xxviii pans long, like the Cow of La
<lb />Rochelle. But to such pieces one gives reinforcement at the breech
<lb />as of three balls. At range, they can shoot around one league,
<lb />& a half league at point-blank. Its charge is like the
<lb />bastarde. And if one wants to fire at some cavalry
<lb />quite far off, one increases the powder a little. A tail of smoke
<lb />follows the ball which <-de-> guides your
<lb />sight [<-e->] to where the ball is going. This goes for the
<lb />cannon and for the culverin, and not for small pieces.

<lb />The average weighs 18 quintals &
<lb />measures xii pans long.
<lb />Its ball weighs eight or 9 lb & its charge is six
<lb />pounds of powder. <-And for-> At the breech it
<lb />carries a thickness of three balls, & in front, two. It is
<lb />more appropriate for the defense of a city than for battery.
<lb />However, one takes it sometimes either to break a barricade
<lb />or to support the battery after the cannons have fired, in order to
<lb />prevent the assailed from re-fortifying after the cannons have played or
<lb />fired. Four horses can draw it. It shoots eight or nine hundred 
<lb />paces at point-blank & almost as much as the
<lb />bastarde.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To cannons & large pieces one gives<-n-> as much
<lb />powder as is the diameter of a ball & a half, at
<lb />which point the escutcheon sits. To medium pieces, such as
<lb />field pieces, & smaller ones, one gives them powder the
<lb />thickness of two balls. To the passe-volant & other smaller
<lb />ones, one gives them powder the thickness of three
<lb />balls. In general, one charges all pieces up to the
<lb />escutcheon. One charges with the ladle all
<lb />pieces from the cannon to the piece of four quintals
<lb /><-de char->, and one gives them two
<lb />ladles of cannon powder or one & a half
<lb />of arquebus powder. To smaller ones, one only gives one
<lb />ladle, & those of one quintal are
<lb />charged with a small charge.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The field piece weighs ten or twelve quintals & is ten
<lb />pans long or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii lb
<lb />& its charge is 4 lb of powder. At the breech it has
<lb />three balls & two in front, as do all pieces that are smaller than
<lb />the average. One gives them more of a breech because one makes them
<lb />longer in proportion, and also because in a house or
<lb />elsewhere one fires them more frequently than the large pieces.
<lb />Their caliber is also small, which makes the breech 3 balls
<lb />thick. They are used for following a camp promptly & for the defense
<lb />of cities & houses, putting them on the
<lb />walls or on a tower. One needs three good
<lb />horses for drawing it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The passe-volant weighs vi quintals, is eight or nine
<lb />pans long. Its ball weighs two lb, &, for
<lb />its charge, a lb & a half of powder. At the breech
<lb />it has three balls & two in the front. Two horses can move
<lb />it, for a single horse does not begin to move a piece. It is
<lb />used for the defense of houses, or for taking among the
<lb />infantry to break a rank of cavalry.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The falconet weighs 4 quintals, is x
<lb />pans long. Its ball weighs one lb & a
<lb />quarter, its charge is half a lb of powder. At the
<lb />breech three balls, at the front, two. To move it, two horses,
<lb />although such pieces are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
<lb />defend houses. The ones which are carted around either for
<lb />battery or for siege combat, are cannons, culverins, medium-sized
<lb />bastardes & field

<lb />pieces. The falconet is loaded with a ladle, and one
<lb />commonly gives it only one ladle. There are also
<lb />other falconets weighing three quintals, and which
<lb />are nine pans long. Their ball weighs half a
<lb />lb. Their charge is a quarter of powder. It is loaded
<lb />either with a ladle, but more commonly with a charge. At the
<lb />breech, 3 balls, & 2 in front. To the small pieces which
<lb />are under 3 quintals one gives them at least 3 balls
<lb />& a twelfth part of a ball at the breech, & sometimes
<lb />takes away from the front to make this addition to the breech, according
<lb />to the length one gives them.
</ab>
<ab>

<lb />the escutcheon, which in these small pieces can amount to 3
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />or 4 balls of arquebus powder. For if one uses
<lb />cannon powder, one can load it to a thickness of <-c->
<lb />five balls.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to understand all of this as iron balls. When one
<lb />shoots a metal ball, one over-charges by a quarter
<lb />ladle because if a cannon ball weighs 40
<lb />lb, the metal one weighs lx lb. One also takes
<lb />the gun-sight higher when shooting a metal ball. For if one
<lb />shoots an [<-iron->] iron ball point-blank, one takes six lines
<lb />higher when shooting metal balls. A metal ball <-makes->
<lb />alloyed with copper, in order that it is not frangible, is more
<lb />effective hitting at close range than that of iron. But the
<lb />iron one hits more fiercely from afar.

<lb />It is necessary to have millet pilled to remove the

<lb />grind it again quite finely and pass it through a hair sieve
<lb />quite finely. This done, it is necessary to mix the flour with
<lb />melted fresh butter and milk, and that there be
<lb />as much of one as the other, in such a manner that it is very light in color,
<lb />like the dough to make fritters. And you will put in egg

<lb />to two egg yolks for each millas.
<lb />Then you will put in some saffron, if you like, to give

<lb />Next, you need to have molds, and it is

<lb />then, having made a good fire, you will clean the place in the

<lb />millas, and then you will take your molds and
<lb />grease them quite heavily in order that the dough does not stick when it is
<lb />cooked. Having done that, you will put your said molds on the
<lb />well-cleaned place in the hearth and will put a
<lb />little flour at the bottom and fill them with the aforementioned
<lb />dough. Next you will cover the said molds with
<lb />lids which will be made like the molds, but it is
<lb />necessary that they be larger and not be open at the top. Then having

<ab>
<lb />Glass from Lorraine is smoother & more even than
<lb />plate glass and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly
<lb />it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
<lb />because the glassmakers, having made it, put it when totally
<lb />hot on straw, which stains it in this way. However, this
<lb />is removed with varnish & salt & other
<lb />drugs that the glassworkers put on. Glass from Lorraine is sold by the bundle & each
<lb />bundle is composed of three tablets.
<lb />The bundle costs usually x sous.
<lb />Plate glass is <-sold in-> made in France, it is
<lb />whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
<lb />Lorraine. It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is
<lb />better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
<lb />shape of a frame, because they cannot be set quite evenly.

<lb />Gunner
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />As for small cannons which are not loaded with a ladle,
<lb />one charges them with powder up to the escutcheon, which
<lb />is placed on the piece with due proportion.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To point a cannon, that is to say to take its aim, one needs to take
<lb />the sight, that is to say aim, from the sides before the top, that is to
<lb />say above the cannon. For by aiming along the top, you will be better
<lb />able to find the line tending to your target, but you would not find out
<lb />if the cannon tends more to one side than the other. Therefore take your
<lb />sight on one side, then on the other & adjust your piece to the
<lb />point at which you aim. Then take your sight from the top of the breech,
<lb />which will be done quickly. Next, lower your piece a little at your
<lb />discretion if you are within true range, because the force of the
<lb />powder usually makes it rise. But if you were farther away than
<lb />your piece shoots at point-blank, you would need to consider that the
<lb />weight of the ball would make it lower.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For firing a cannon at night
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some keep their pieces loaded <-and-> from the day. Then, in
<lb />order that the gunner can fire into the breach where the
<lb />assailed are perhaps making repairs, the besiegers raise a false alarm
<lb />in order that the besieged throw torches & artificial
<lb />fire into the moats or around the breach, at which the
<lb />gunner aims. Sometimes, by using the reflection of
<lb />mirrors or flasks full of water, the assailants
<lb />light up the breach. The method you know, with a quadrant &
<lb />plumb line, is very good. Others nail two or three rows
<lb />of boards with strong iron pegs on the wooden platform
<lb />made for mounting the cannon, and leave empty notches into which the
<lb />wheels of the cannon can just fit. And by such means you will always
<lb /><-te-> place it at a similar <-q->
<lb />point, that it will not incline more to the right than to the left. And
<lb />in order that it be neither too high nor too low, when you fire during
<lb />the day, you place a ruler fixed well in the ground, which
<lb />comes just to touch the the bottom of the edge of the cannon after it
<lb />has been pointed & adjusted for firing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the
<lb />platform, the wheels, or the
<lb />wedges break or are disturbed, this
<lb />invention is of no profit.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f041" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Others place two poles fixed well into
<lb />the earth such that one is <-equally-> as far from the edge
<lb /><-and->of the muzzle of the 
<lb />cannon as the other. And underneath they place the above-mentioned
<lb />ruler. Then when they want to fire at
<lb />night, they push their cannon straight toward the above-mentioned
<lb />ruler & make it so that the edge of the mouth rests on the
<lb />end of the aforesaid ruler. Next, they measure with a
<lb />ruler or similar thing cut to measure, from one pole to the
<lb />side of the cannon & if it is too close or too far from it, they
<lb />adjust it & do thus from the side of the other pole.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For unspiking a cannon
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some say that one should remove the ball if the cannon is loaded
<lb />& give fire through the mouth of the cannon. But it is to be
<lb />believed that the fire would sooner exit that way than going to seek its
<lb />exit through its usual touch-hole which is
<lb />spiked & constrained. The most reliable way is that the
<lb />gunner, who is often a founder, wedges &
<lb />thoroughly rivets the nail that the enemies placed, and with a
<lb />trepan makes <-at the side-> another touch-hole next to
<lb />the one which has been spiked, which will be done in an hour. And if
<lb />with time the violence of the powder loosens the nail with
<lb />which the piece is spiked, you will make a thread in the second
<lb />touch-hole & place a screw in it quite perfectly which will
<lb />never come undone. <-M->

<lb />Defense of a town
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />There is nothing that has a greater effect for the defense of a
<lb />breach than petards placed at the entryway at the time of the assault.
<lb />They carry a lot of ammunition. <-be-> One fills them
<lb />with cart nails, large steel dice, bits of chain
<lb />& similar things. And when one senses that the enemies are close,
<lb />one sets fire to all. Grenades, too, well-made and aptly thrown, cause
<lb />great damage. And to make them worse, one puts coarsely
<lb /><-pestling-> pestled glass either in the molds or in the
<lb />crucible, when one wants to cast them; this worsens the wounds.
<lb />The grenades ought not to be too brittle. But it is good that they be
<lb />somewhat alloyed with the substance of the pieces in order that,
<lb />holding the blast a little rather than breaking, they have more
<lb />violence.

<lb />[On petards]
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />Such a petard is made which weighs three quintals, carries
<lb />a cannonball flat on the side on which it must exit & round on the
<lb />inside of the cannon, as if it were a cannonball cut in half. It is two
<lb />pans long. It is charged with xxv lb of
<lb />powder for <-at-> it needs to be full up to the mouth
<lb />& it needs to burst. It does not have a different thickness at the
<lb />breech than at the mouth & is all of one piece. Its substance needs
<lb />to be better than that of pieces, & for 4 quintals of
<lb />fine copper there ought to be only one quintal of
<lb />metal in order that it holds the blast, &, bursting with more
<lb />force, has a greater effect. It is for putting against a door with a
<lb />large iron cross in front of the ball, and <-s->once loaded, it needs
<lb />to be covered with a well-sewn thick canvas which should be
<lb />anointed <-c-> all over with turpentine. It needs
<lb />to have four handles, made while it is founded, for it is thus easier to
<lb />place. The iron cross is joined to the mouth with the
<lb />canvas with which it is covered. <-To place it, it-> The
<lb />handles must be kept at the edge of its muzzle, as you see. To place it,
<lb />one needs three or four iron pegs one
<lb />pan long & as thick as a
<lb />finger which should have their point like a
<lb /><-wimble-> gimlet, & the entire leg as
<lb />a screw, like an auger, & a ring on the
<lb />other end to turn them with a short stick which has play within
<lb />the ring. And the pegs are placed in the door <-but->
<lb />not straight <-but-> for they would not have any strength, but at an
<lb />angle as if you wanted to fix them toward the middle of the
<lb />petard, and to do this, the hole of the handles needs to be quite large.
<lb />In this way, the firing petard pushes the pegs along &
<lb />across into the door & makes more of a breach. Once it is placed,
<lb />you need to have a buckram sausage
<lb />made in this manner: take eight or nine canes of
<lb />buckram strip or more if the ditch is larger, and let the strip
<lb />be four or five fingers wide. Have it well sewn in
<lb />such a way that it is like a gut through <-l->which a
<lb />stick as thick as a finger can pass. Fill it
<lb />completely with good
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This one is for putting below an undermined tower with the muzzle
<lb />pointing up. One makes two large iron rings & with a
<lb />bar or two, four men carry it. They are also used for putting
<lb />in breaches but here one needs only half a charge, namely x lb,
<lb />& to fill it with flint stones & cart flint
<lb />stones.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to cover it entirely with waxed canvas & rubbed
<lb />with turpentine & combustible things. This cover is
<lb />made in order to secure the ball, such that it does not fall and in
<lb />order that when the fire takes to the cover, the primer powder
<lb />does not fail. Precisely at the fuse, you will need to put in a good
<lb />quantity of primer powder. Some put a cross of iron on the
<lb />ball which exptends beyond the mouth of the petard by two
<lb />pans. Others only put the ball.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />

<lb />powder. When the sausage is full, dip it <-well in->
<lb />lightly, to wet the canvas & not the powder, in two
<lb />parts of vinegar & <-of-> one of
<lb />eau-de-vie. Next, let the said canvas dry well, and then
<lb />one needs to join to the said sausage a long string or
<lb />cord which should be two times longer than the
<lb />sausage, & one ought not to tighten it to the sausage but only
<lb />to bind it to it at both ends & to sew it on the sausage in a few
<lb />places in the middle. Next one needs to anoint the entire sausage with
<lb />very good turpentine. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And at whichever end of it you wish to join
<lb /> to the touch-hole of the petard for giving fire, you can sew
<lb /><-a-> or tightly attach a large strip of canvas one
<lb />empan wide which should also be well soaked in
<lb />turpentine; & this strip must be split in the middle in order
<lb />to wrap & tie it around the petard, and one needs to attach it in
<lb />such a way that <-the touch-hole should be close to the me the-> the tip of the sausage, which should be open,
<lb />should be joined to the touch-hole of the petard. Then one needs to put
<lb />a lot of tightly-pressed powder onto the touch-hole of the
<lb />petard. And next, the one outside the ditch needs to pull the
<lb />thread & cord that is joined to the sausage until
<lb />it is moderately extended, but not so much that it is detached<-sen->. And if
<lb />there was water in the ditch, one would need to support the
<lb />sausage with forks. Then, the one who holds the end of the sausage will
<lb />be able to give fire, having gotten himself to safety, & the others
<lb />also.

<lb />[On petards]
<lb />Petards that one wants to place on doors or iron grates are
<lb />sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 lb. Moreover, as for its
<lb />charge, ball, & fashion of proceeding, one needs to do all as is
<lb />already said above, concerning the one of 3 quintals. One man
<lb />can carry it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The ball needs to be be round on one side & flat on the other
<lb />like <-a half ball-> a half of a cut ball. It is also
<lb />necessary that the cross is held to the ball and that it, when the ball
<lb />is founded if you make it from metal, is bound up with the middle
<lb />of the cross.

<lb />Grenades
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Grenades must be made from the finest metal one can find, for
<lb />there is fine metal and crude metal. Fine
<lb />metal is that of a large bell, because one
<lb />puts in more copper to give it a bigger voice, & for small
<lb />bells one puts more tin to give it a <-bigger-> clearer
<lb />sound. The metal of a large bell is made <-one-> with
<lb />3 quintals of rosette & twenty or xxv
<lb />lb of tin. <-Tan-> Each grenade must
<lb />weigh four to six lb. And in order to throw them, it is necessary
<lb />that they be full of powder mixed with coarsely pestled
<lb />glass. And for a quarter lb of powder, one needs
<lb />half an ounce of glass which is put with it, in order
<lb />that on the face or places where the powder will have its effect,
<lb />the wounds will be all the worse for it. The best arquebus
<lb />powder is required here. The hole needs to be as large as the
<lb />thickness of a swan’s quill, & you need not bother to
<lb />make it threaded, but it is enough to make it even. Next, you make a
<lb />well-soldered pipe of fer blanc, 
<lb />which can enter into the hole & enter into the middle of
<lb />the grenade & which comes out of it by the width of one
<lb />finger. You will fill it with good powder, pestled
<lb />in a mortar & lightly mixed with good eau-de-vie or
<lb />strong vinegar <-which seems->. <-And when-> This is done to
<lb />temper the powder. And to know if it will be slow enough to allow
<lb />leisure to throw the grenade without danger, try this powder thus
<lb />bathed in another pipe. You can keep <-d-> your loaded
<lb />grenades in a very dry place, & on the contrary you shall
<lb />keep your pipes filled with that bathed and well-compressed
<lb />powder in a humid place. And nonetheless, you shall
<lb />have some already inserted into <-the-> some grenades,
<lb />to be always provisioned. And every three days you shall
<lb />change them if you recognize that they have become too dry. To throw
<lb />your grenade, take it bravely <-&-> in one hand
<lb />& with the other give fire to your pipe with <-the-> a
<lb />match, & throw it promptly amidst the
<lb /><-powder-> troops. The thickness of the
<lb />grenade should be twice the back edge of
<lb />a knife.

<lb />Commonly, there are not many garrets & other defenses in
<lb />that place. And when one has made a breach at the strongest part & the
<lb />cannon removed, it will surprise the assailed. One approaches
<lb />fortified towns at night, but to poorly
<lb />fortified towns, pioneers bring gabions and
<lb /><-carry-> once these are placed, one puts some boards or planks
<lb />behind the gabions to keep the pioneers safe, while behind,

<lb />shovels. And while one does this, one raises some false alarm
<lb />on another side. And before, one has

<lb />on each side <-m-> if there is only one cannon. But if
<lb />there are more, the platforms touch. The distance which is between the

<lb />a hundred paces away from the battery & one surrounds

<lb />powder in bags or frails. And each piece has
<lb />its own frail for loading three or four times. Then, when the
<lb />cannon is set on the platform, one puts a board that is proof of an
<lb />arquebus between two gabions. Then a gunner loads it with a
<lb />ladle, & with the rammer which is at
<lb /><-len-> the other end of the ladle, two men
<lb />ram the powder as much as they can, in nine or ten pushes, until
<lb />they find the powder to be hard & well-compacted. Next,
<lb />another puts hay or straw and the <-r-> others
<lb />ram a little. Another puts the ball and the hay-bearer puts in
<lb />as much of it as before & one rams a little. Some put
<lb />wooden bungs but this runs the risk of making the piece
<lb />burst. And where one has to fire many <-cannon-> shots, one
<lb />would need many bungs, which would cost much to carry. Once the
<lb />cannon is loaded, xx or xxv pioneers push it forward with
<lb />bars, keeping to one side behind the gabions without taking off the
<lb />board until the cannon reaches it. Once the cannon is in front, the
<lb />gunner mounts it with the wedges which are at the
<lb />back, taking the sight on each side and then in the middle. Then another
<lb />who is nearby gives fire. Each <-gunner-> cannon needs
<lb />3 gunners: the loader, the one who aims, the one who gives
<lb />fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a breach, one shoots cartridges,
<lb />made as you have elsewhere, or else one uses a basan full of
<lb />flint stones, cart nails & similar.
<lb /><-P-> A <-ch-> cannon must not move

<lb />for it. This is done for big pieces, but for <-gr->
<lb />small pieces <-from-> lesser than the average, one
<lb />needs to observe the aforesaid proportion, & draw the piece in a
<lb />continuous line from one end to the other. The trunnions are commonly
<lb />situated one foot from the ring of the middle,
<lb /><-from-> toward the edge of the breech.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />But because some gunners prefer a piece which is weighted at the front
<lb />because it is easier to plant, to do this, one only needs to move the
<lb />trunnions closer to the breech & further away from the middle. On
<lb />the contrary, if you want to render it <-s->
<lb />more weighted at the back, you will move the trunnions
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />closer to the middle of the piece or place them further up toward the
<lb />mouth. When you bore your piece you make a fluted cast iron box
<lb />like a bedpost & there ought to be sixteen channels or notches in
<lb />which you will slot sixteen blades quite evenly,
<lb /><-with-> in order that all together they cut & scrape in the
<lb />same manner. Because if some were to not cut & scrape, chambers
<lb />& waves would be made in the cannon which would make it lopsided and
<lb />there would be a danger that the piece might break in the middle. In
<lb />order to avoid this, it is necessary that the borer should pass
<lb />evenly from the breech to the mouth, & that the opening of the piece
<lb />should be evenly bored from one end to the other, because thus the
<lb />powder goes off all at once with more force. On the contrary, if
<lb />restrained, it goes sideways & makes the piece break.

<lb />They are made better in crucible form, <-hollow at the->
<lb />narrower at the bottom & becoming larger toward the muzzle. It is
<lb />necessary to pestle the powder thoroughly & put on top of it either
<lb />sand or cork or better still a fitted plate of wax
<lb />thoroughly pestled on top, for it seals precisely & makes for
<lb />greater force. The ball only makes a hole, the powder alone makes
<lb />more of an effect. One holds that, once loaded & kept in a dry place
<lb />for fifteen days, they have more force.

<lb />Pewterers
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They deem the best tin is the one that comes in
<lb />saulmons, which has not been remelted since it came from the
<lb />mine, because the masters remelt it <-a-> in
<lb />grille, weighing two or three lb, to easily
<lb />cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often make a mixture of
<lb />leftovers from plates, solder & common tin.
<lb />And to recognize the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks
<lb />burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their saulmons they find pieces of iron, stones & similar
<lb />jumble to cheat on the weight. The tin from England is so hard that the miners put in
<lb />lead to soften it. The one that comes by way of Germany
<lb />is softer. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Commonly, the sworn master pewterers from
<lb />bonnes villes add six lb of fine
<lb />lead <-on-> or eight on a quintal of fine
<lb />tin. The others, who work in the countryside,
<lb />put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness
<lb />of the lead <-il-> and its softness, they put in
<lb />looking-glass tin, 4 lb per quintal,
<lb />+ <-po-> which whitens & hardens,
<lb />and <-a little-> six or eight lb of rosette on a
<lb />quintal to render the plate sonorous. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To mold platters & dishes, they make them out of pierre
<lb /><-porte-> morte, which is
<lb />grais, & they turn & polish <-around->
<lb />them on the wheel. They melt their tin in an
<lb /><-dest-> iron pot on a charcoal fire, and with an iron spoon that holds
<lb /><-almost-> a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast
<lb /><-leu-> in their cold molds, which they keep
<lb />joined & tight between their knees. And soon after, they
<lb />open the molds so that they do not heat up, & having taken
<lb />out the cast which is on the female side, & which breaks easily.
<lb />Then, with a cloth which soaks in water, which they
<lb />always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish
<lb />& around the edge, so that it comes out better, and rub the
<lb />female mold with it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the tin is fine, one adds less glass-looking tin,
<lb />namely 4 lb per quintal, but if the tin is base, 
<lb />that is to say alloyed with a lot of lead, one puts
<lb />at least five or six lb of looking-glass tin to it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If there is hardly any looking-glass tin, one puts about two or
<lb />three lb per quintal. One puts eight lb of
<lb />rosette. But if there is a lot of looking-glass tin,
<lb /><-one-> like 4 or 5 lb, one only puts six of
<lb />rosette. And commonly, per quintal of tin, one
<lb />adds x lb of both.

<lb />Stucco for molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take tragacanth gum and put it to soak until, having drunk
<lb />its water, it is swollen & rendered like jelly. Then
<lb />grind it quite hard on marble & next take
<lb />rye flour, which is better than wheat
<lb />because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and
<lb />sprinkle your tragacanth gum with it, & continue to grind
<lb />and mix in thus, little by little, <-it and mix
<lb />legi-> the very finely sieved flour. And knead it as if
<lb />you wanted to make bread, until <-you-> you perceive that
<lb />it has enough body & is as firm as bread dough that one is
<lb />ready to put in the oven. This is recognized when it can
<lb />stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it
<lb />would not <-sti-> release well. Once the paste is prepared, rub
<lb />the hollow form <-at the u-> with oil, with a
<lb />brush, in order that the oil penetrates everywhere to make it
<lb />release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does
<lb />not release well, mix in more flour until it has enough body.
<lb />With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which
<lb />will be dry within one day. Next, you will apply them with
<lb />strong glue or paste glue, as you like, and you will be
<lb />able to paint and decorate them with gold & all colors. One
<lb />makes ceiling ornaments with it in Rome. One can make bed
<lb />ornaments with it. If you want that the work stays white, it
<lb />is better to mold with plaster instead of flour. It is
<lb />true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare
<lb />it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <-strong->, in a
<lb />good amount of water so that it is clear, & grind
<lb />it several times a day for fifteen days. Then pour off the
<lb />water by tilting, and gather the plaster & grind it
<lb />finely on marble, & place it in some kind of
<lb />clean lead vessel, so that no dust & dirt falls into
<lb />it, & leave it in the open air & in the serain 
<lb />for fifteen days with its water, and
<lb />it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making
<lb />a seat for burnished gold. And this, in powder form, you
<lb />can mix, instead of flour, with tragacanth gum, and your
<lb />work will be very beautiful. Lacking plaster, you can mix in well
<lb />ground chalk or ceruse, & try bole &
<lb />similar things. This stucco with the tragacanth gum has
<lb />the quality that, yielding when it is not yet dry, it can be accommodated on either
<lb />round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little
<lb />expense.

<lb />Dragon’s blood
</ab>

<lb />The darker dragon’s blood
<lb />is the best & has more of a tint; it is the tear that is found in <-gr-> pieces like

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />.    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red.
<lb />And in a glass bottle put the best eau-de-vie you can find, in sufficient quantity. <-For
<lb />it-> And stop it well and so diligently that it does not vent,
<lb />otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for a
<lb />long time, because the longer it stays <-there->, the
<lb />more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is
<lb />good, otherwise it will become like wine lees. When you want to use
<lb />it, make a small hole in the stopper of the bottle & pour a
<lb />little & stop it again each time, then apply it on gold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The good kind of dragon’s blood can be found in
<lb />large pieces like pieces of cake this one has no value and is
<lb />adulterated, & once broken it shows on its edges scales,
<lb />transparent as <-ro-> rouge clair enamel, it is
<lb />also lumpy in some parts like small rubies. The eau-de-vie needs to be very ardent &
<lb />passed several times.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I put it in common eau-de-vie, mixing in some
<lb />aquafortis to give it strength. At the beginning the
<lb />water took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an
<lb />appearance of tragacanth gum with which I think they adulterate
<lb />the dragon’s blood.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When it is applied on burnished gold, it is prone to break. For
<lb />this reason, some coat it with turpentine varnish. Cold delays
<lb />the action of the water and the extraction of the color. And for
<lb />this reason, one can keep it close to the fire.

<lb />They also make their molds from metal which lasts
<lb />longer & molds more cleanly than grais, because the
<lb />plate comes out without flashing & smooth. But this is for the
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />rich because a mold costs fifteen or sixteen
<lb />frans. They are mainly made of metal, for basins &
<lb />ewers & salt cellars & similar things which are fashioned.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For pints, molds are made with
<lb />white clay earth mixed with horse dung & cloth
<lb />waste & well beaten, because the pints, being sunk in a half round,
<lb />would not be able to release as well from the grais mold
<lb />as from the earth, which is soft. One makes the noyau of 
<lb />the mold of the said pints in grais.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In metal molds, one makes vents and casts all at once,
<lb />which is the reason that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line
<lb />which comes from the vapor & fumes of the metal that is cast,
<lb />which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy & very often
<lb />pierced. However they repair it with solder <-of the 
<lb />n->, as is said. These fumes are made right in the middle of the
<lb />cast, & in grais molds.

<lb />The plate can be hammered <-mar-> to make

<lb />Depending on the size of their platters & plates, they have

<pb facs="#f059" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />any dish or plate, they loosen & undo with the strike of a
<lb />hammer the iron wedges that slide along the spokes of
<lb />the wheel. And, when they are at the notch and points that they
<lb />need, they tighten the said wedges, wedging them with the
<lb />hammer.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed,
<lb />& purged of surrounding flashing with the hot soldering
<lb />iron & then with a large file, they adapt it on the
<lb />wheel; & first of all they wrap their
<lb /><-desgrusoue-> desgrusouer
<lb />with a rope, as thick [<-rope->] as
<lb />the little finger, & lean it firmly on the
<lb />crossbar to secure it well. And while someone else promptly
<lb />turns the wheel, they guide the sharp edge of the
<lb />esgrusouer by hand
<lb /><-s-> toward the edge of the round hollow, & gently
<lb />guide it to the center of the circle. And this
<lb />desgrusouer is for removing the first rough &
<lb />lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a[<-e->] cutting
<lb />iron called a plane, the sharp edge of which
<lb />they rub with a little putty on leather nailed
<lb />onto a piece of wood <-having->, and this in such a way
<lb />that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this
<lb />plane was not thus rubbed & burnished, it would
<lb />not polish & <-not-> burnish the tin,
<lb /><-au-> which would stay white, & not black &
<lb />burnished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second
<lb />time with this plane as they did with the
<lb />esgrusouer. Then, with a knife or another
<lb />sharp iron, they scrape the edges of the platters or
<lb />plates to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f060" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Their hammers must be quite even & polished, and if by
<lb />chance the rust, <-the-> or some other use, has
<lb />damaged them, they first polish them with emery stone powder,
<lb />then they finish burnishing & smoothing with the putty.
<lb />Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the
<lb />surface of the anvils be the same.

<lb />They buy rosette at xx lb a quintal,
<lb />which is harder to melt than latten because it is softer. For,
<lb />the softer the great metals
<lb /># are, the <-soft-> more difficult they are
<lb />to melt. The tin for bells, which is fine tin
<lb /><-is more-> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than lead,
<lb />which is soft. Latten made brittle by the calamine is
<lb />melted more quickly than red copper. The metal, which is the
<lb />substance of bells, mixed with tin, and very brittle, is soon
<lb />melted. The more silver is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
<lb />why solder is made with it. In Germany they make very
<lb />light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
<lb />water, but they are breakable. A quintal of

<lb />Knife for cutting the nose or a

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This is a well-furbished knife, nailed through the
<lb />middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side & the other
<lb />& the side <-[illegible]-> A, as readily as the side B, is hidden 
<lb />inside its handle marked C. The two tenons you see at the tip of
<lb />the knife are for locking it on one side or the other against a
<lb />nail which is at the butt of the said handle, in order 
<lb />that, when one wants to press hard on something to
<lb />cut it, it does not come out from the handle. You may allow the
<lb />side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, but not
<lb />much, but the side that is notched <-A-> and marked A must
<lb />not cut. <-It-> It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
<lb />also the notch needs to be as thick as the back of a
<lb />knife in order that it cannot cause pain. And you
<lb />will only show the part of the knife which is not notched, for
<lb />the side with the notch needs to be <-mar-> hidden
<lb />inside the handle. And when you want to cut the nose
<lb />or a finger, pretend to sharpen your knife on the
<lb />thigh and, while <-while-> doing this, turn the
<lb />knife deftly. & the part with the notch, which you will
<lb />cover <-l-> with one finger, will come into
<lb />your hand, and you will place the notch, colored with
<lb />brazilwood rosette or black cherry juice, upon
<lb />the nose.

<lb />Take a token or piece of silver and wet it

<lb />bystander that if you put it thus on his forehead,
<lb />he will not be able to make it fall without lifting his hands
<lb />to it, no matter how he shakes his head. And making it seem as
<lb />if you are placing it on his forehead, retain it in your
<lb />hand & wet your thumb with your
<lb />saliva then press it quite strongly on his
<lb />forehead. And thinking he has the piece on his
<lb />forehead due to the coolness of the

<lb />For making blood or wine issue from

<lb />Take a funnel or funnel of fer blanc which is double-walled in the body <-d->

<lb /><-au-> another, slightly bigger, on the inner wall that
<lb />will be a little above the spout, just as you can see in the adjacent
<lb />example. Then when you want to use it, put in wine
<lb />or liquid rosette of Brazilwood or black cherry
<lb />juice, and blocking the hole of the spout <-the-> with your
<lb />little finger, make sure that the funnel is well
<lb />filled in order that the wine can enter <-there-> between the
<lb />double walls through the hole at the side, & if it does not enter
<lb />well, making it seem as if you are tasting the wine,
<lb />suck & draw in a little air, drinking where the little hole
<lb />is. Next, make one of the close bystanders drink the rest of
<lb />the wine or cast it aside or let it flow through the tip, but
<lb />before, you must have pressed your thumb well over the hole on
<lb />the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of air, the
<lb />wine will be retained between the double walls. Then with a
<lb />bodkin rounded at the tip & that goes into its handle, you
<lb />make it seem as if you pierce the forehead of someone who holds
<lb />a glass in his hand, and while you pierce, you
<lb />cover what you are doing with the funnel that you hold
<lb />close to #
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />#
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />his forehead. Then removing your thumb from over the
<lb />hole on the top edge, the air, being free, will make the
<lb />wine issue from between the double walls through the hole marked
<lb />B, & fall through the tip marked C into the glass.
<lb />But you must make the fellow bend his head enough in

<lb />For melting or transmuting a jewel put inside a

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a box of boxwood banded with rings, as you see,
<lb />into which will easily fit another small box, like that which
<lb />you see marked B, and make it so that it does not touch the bottom of the
<lb />large one marked A, but that there is some distance. Also, that which enters
<lb />the large box must be smooth, but the rim must be made with
<lb />rings so that, being joined, it appears as if they are one and the same
<lb />box. You must also have a round leather cover of the
<lb />same length as the box, as you see marked C, which fits
<lb /><-let-> easily & surrounds the said
<lb />boxes thus placed one within the other. But before you do your
<lb />trick, you must put at the bottom of the larger box powdered
<lb />gold or silver, or mercury amalgamated with silver,
<lb />and then place the little box marked B on top. Next, holding
<lb />the box with your index finger on top, you present
<lb />it, and seeing only the bottom of the smaller
<lb />box marked B, one places a jewel or something
<lb />similar in it. This being done, placing the box on the
<lb />table, you cover it with the leather box, and
<lb />making the requisite gestures, you will remove the leather
<lb />box, & without showing the inside, will put it on the
<lb />table & let it be recognized that the jewel is
<lb /><-in the-> placed in the bottom of the small box marked
<lb />B. Then you will gently place the leather box back,
<lb />& after saying
<lb />inhonorificabilitidinita<-d->tudinibus, you will take
<lb />the top of the leather box with two fingers,
<lb />and <-with the-> clasping it more firmly than usual, at the same
<lb />time you <-d-> will lift <-pe-> the
<lb />smaller box that is inside & which contains the
<lb />jewel, & you will gently put both on the table,
<lb />then you will pour the powder or amalgam that is at the bottom of the
<lb />large box, then replace the leather box with
<lb />the box inside it, as it was at the start. Then, removing the
<lb />leather box without removing the smaller one, you will
<lb />show the jewel at the bottom which has returned to its previous
<lb />state, holding your index finger on the rim of the box
<lb />so that it does not slip.

<lb />weight on their tips laid down & arranged in a triangle, edge to
<lb />edge, as you can see, & they would not touch the ground. And if,
<lb />after arranging them this way, you turn them the other way without
<lb />unjoining them, the tips of the handles can also support a large weight
<lb />without touching the ground. You can easily adapt this to another
<lb />use with pikes, with joists, or to promptly make a tripod in a
<lb />camp with three halberd points. If the edge of the
<lb />knife marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the

<lb />For transmuting grain from one vessel to

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take two small wooden bushels of the same
<lb />size, which should be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the
<lb />width of the back of a knife or more. One of these
<lb />will remain empty, & on the bottom of the other you will glue
<lb />kernels of grain with starch such that it will be
<lb />covered entirely with grain, & it will seem to be
<lb />filled with it. Take also a wooden bell into which you
<lb />will place as much grain as can be held within the
<lb />capacity of one of the bushels, and over the top put a simple
<lb />piece of leather that fits tightly inside the
<lb />bell. Put all into a bag or a napkin or a
<lb />folded handkerchief, if you do not want to use a
<lb />conjuror’s pouch. First show the empty
<lb />bushel, then in front of the audience fill it with
<lb />grain, then put it back in the napkin. Next,
<lb />leave that one there & take the other where the
<lb />grain is glued with starch
<lb />& it will seem to be the first one, filled with
<lb />grain. Put it under a hat & place the
<lb />bell gently on the table for the first time. And if
<lb />you like, promptly & without stopping, show the bottom which will be
<lb />covered with white leather of the color of the
<lb />wood. Then pretending to show the bushel that is
<lb />under the hat, you will turn it deftly to the side that is
<lb />empty & leave it covered. Then you will command that by
<lb />invisibilium the grain pass into the
<lb />bell, which you will have tapped shortly before on the
<lb />table a little strongly, & the grain will
<lb />fall to the bottom & cover the piece of leather.
<lb />Then lift the hat; the bushel

<ab>
<lb />Make a small sheath of plain leather, such as cow or

<lb />fingers, sewn like the finger of a glove & large
<lb />enough that two fingertips can fit inside & which, at
<lb />the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole as large as a
<lb />double liard. Take <-one-> two similar
<lb />boxwood balls, & let one be hollow &
<lb />open with a round hole on one side only so that the thimble can
<lb />fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
<lb />leather sheath on the table with the
<lb />ball that is not hollow. Pass a stick inside the
<lb />leather sheath to show that there is nothing there, also
<lb />show the full ball, and hold the one which is hollow & has
<lb />the thimble inside it by your little finger & ring
<lb />finger, and do this with your right hand
<lb />with which you are holding the stick. Next, you take your
<lb />leather sheath & place it over the hollow
<lb />ball which is in your fingers, & making it seem as
<lb />if you are putting some oribus powder over it, you put
<lb />back the leather mold that
<lb />contains the ball with the thimble on the
<lb />table, then you take the round & solid ball
<lb />remaining on the table, and command it to enter from under the
<lb />table into the leather sheath. Then, when lifting
<lb />the leather, it seems to be the same,
<lb />although it is the hollow one. Then you cover it again & command it to
<lb />become invisible. And then, lifting the sheath while pressing
<lb />it, you will remove it & the ball along with it; &
<lb /><-l-> putting it aside with the sheath,
<lb /><-& a [illegible]-> in its place will be found a thimble

<lb />Glassworkers’ glass
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One says that in Lorraine & in Flanders
<lb />well-made glass is made of fern ashes &
<lb />pebbles, and first they blow a long bubble, which another
<lb />worker, with long shears, cleaves & cuts lengthwise.
<lb />Then, having set this long, cleft bubble on a stone or
<lb />large plate that is in the furnace, a little less
<lb />hot than for the melt, it is left to stretch out. And again in
<lb />addition to this, they flatten it with a long & thick round
<lb />iron rod, then they remove it to the annealing furnace. 
<lb />It is made in the same way in England more beautifully.
<lb />Near Rouen in France, plate glass is made with
<lb />some <-salt of-> saltwort & pebbles,
<lb />that is whiter & more delicate than that of Lorraine. For
<lb />plate glass can be melted with a candle & not that
<lb />from Lorraine. That of plate is blown in a long bubble, of which
<lb />another cuts the end, then the blower flattens it while turning it &
<lb />while touching it to a surface that is on the ground,
<lb /><-A-> then puts it to anneal. Thus the
<lb />middle, whence it is begun, still remains.

<lb />The glass can be cleft again with the light of a candle

<lb />Some do not apply gris d’escaille to the glass

<lb />glassworker who is working has a stench from his
<lb />nose or his mouth, <-the-> & he
<lb />breathes on the glass, the color will not take on it.
<lb />Those who discovered the invention of working in small works of soft
<lb />enamels use only esmail d’azur, which is blue,
<lb />& esmail colombin, which is the color of purple,
<lb />which they soften with rocaille or leaded glass.
<lb />As for the yellow, they make it from silver, the red from
<lb />sanguine, as is said elsewhere, the black & gray &
<lb />shadows with noir d’escaille, either strong or weak,
<lb />the flesh color with clear sanguine. The green is made first

<lb />tripoli from Bretagne on it with the
<lb />finger, others with a piece of leather

<lb />mounted without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one
<lb />side & the other, & to show their vividness. I have a white one [<-one->]
<lb />that seems to be rough & pierced, and is spotted all over with blue
<lb />blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial & that they
<lb />are of taffer or very clear esmail azuré

<lb />grains, if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with
<lb />emery, they cut it in bevel & polish it. And in this manner,
<lb />they counterfeit very beautiful sapphires. The old 
<lb />esmail d’azur for silver verging on aquamarine was very

<lb />The orangeish color that is in transparent amber and in the

<lb />whitish. But through age <-it-> or wearing it, it acquires this
<lb />reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the file or on
<lb />the wheel do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But
<lb />they only polish it, rubbing it with a willow
<lb />stick or other soft wood dipped into water &
<lb />dusted with tripoli of Brittany, and it takes a
<lb />beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow & you want to intensify
<lb />its color, hang it inside a chimney where there is much
<lb />soot & smoke, and it will take on a reddish-orange
<lb />color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under
<lb />dung to turn it green, like bones. Or smoke it
<lb />in a closed space, with the smoke of safre or

<lb />Goldsmith

<lb />They assemble silver filings with saltpeter which
<lb />refines it & does not make it brittle. But gold filings are
<lb />assembled with borax or, to save the borax, with
<lb />lead, which refines the gold & softens it, for the
<lb />saltpeter would make it brittle, which silver does not do.
<lb />This is why, to save money, goldsmiths use it to assemble, in
<lb />order to save borax, which costs viii sous per
<lb />ounce, & saltpeter x sous per
<lb />lb.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When goldsmiths have thus assembled their silver

<lb />Pastel woad
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is grown in Lauragais where the depth of the earth is so
<lb />fertile that if one were to grow wheat there every
<lb />year, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why
<lb />one alternately does pastel woad and wheat
<lb />there. For the cultivation of pastel woad, one ploughs
<lb />the soil with shovels of iron, as gardeners do.
<lb />Next, one harrows it with rakes, & breaks it up finely as
<lb />for sowing cooking herbs. One commonly sows it on
<lb />St. Anthony’s day in January. One makes eight harvests
<lb />of it. The first ones are better. The best pastel woad
<lb />of Lauragais is the one from Carmail & the one
<lb />from Auragne. And sometimes the pastel woad
<lb />is good in one field & in the one close by it will hardly
<lb />have worth. The goodness of the pastel woad is known
<lb />when, put in the mouth, it gives a taste as of
<lb />vinegar, or when crumbling & breaking it, it has some
<lb />mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the
<lb />dyers’ vat, and to fill a vat with it, one
<lb />needs six balls of it. In this, one dyes several locks of
<lb />wool, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be fifteen
<lb />florins, if it gives xx dyings, xx florins. The good
<lb />kind dyes up to 30 times & commonly up to xxv or 26.

<lb />Tracing some history on glass
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to trace some history in intaglio on glass, you
<lb />can do it in different ways. Lay your glass pane <-on->,
<lb />the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, & having cleaned
<lb />the glass well with lye & ash so that it is not
<lb />greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with noir à
<lb />huile or noir d’escaille with the
<lb />paintbrush; if you want to paint with colors in the
<lb />fashion of glassworkers, who wash their glass pane with
<lb />noir d’escaille & then scrape & clear the parts
<lb />which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for
<lb />shading. But if you want to make gilt histories on glass
<lb />with a background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille of
<lb />goldsmiths, gild your entire glass pane with
<lb />gum water or garlic juice or milk of the fig tree.
<lb />Then moisten your printed history between two wet
<lb />linen cloths, and lay it down on the gilt
<lb />glass. Then with a pin mounted on the end of a small
<lb />stick, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to
<lb />pounce it, & thus you will exactly trace it on the gilding of
<lb />the glass. & next you will clear the background & that
<lb />which needs to be blank with a quite pointy steel awl,
<lb />& neatly follow once more the lines & accomplish your work
<lb />& make your faces & flesh colors in argent moulu;
<lb />then you shall fill the background with azur d’esmail or
<lb />verdigris or fine laque platte 
<lb /><-platte-> tempered with clear
<lb />turpentine, mixed with a little of tear of mastic if you want
<lb />that the colors are more even & do not spread. Next, layer on
<lb />the back of the glass & over the colors a white tin
<lb />leaf. And once this is dry, you can cover the tin leaf
<lb /><-of-> with color to hide your secret. The tin leaf gives
<lb />light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being

<lb />them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your colors &
<lb />leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your tin sheet.

<lb />It renders itself fatty once beaten and also mixed with

<lb />to mix it with half as much sand and a quarter
<lb />or a fifth of horse dung. And leave
<lb />it to dry, then turn it to powder, then sift it to render it fine &
<lb />purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The dung
<lb />renders the earth more amiable & tractable, but it
<lb />is necessary that it be well free of straw & other things.
<lb />And when the earth is very fatty, one needs to give it more sand
<lb />& more dung. But one does find fatty earths,

<lb />The sand <-cast-> for casting should be chosen neither so

<lb />are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
<lb />fatty earth, for the sand does not want it at all, for it makes
<lb />it very porous. But you can give it bond with brick thoroughly
<lb />ground on marble, or plaster or calcined
<lb />alabaster or something similar, or the burned marrow of
<lb />ox horn or burned aspalte throughout. If you grind it quite
<lb />finely on porphyry, it <-s-> acquires

<lb />Colors and gilding on glass
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to give as strong gum water on glass for
<lb /><-the gold as for-> the silver layer as for the
<lb />gold because a silver leaf is twice as strong as a
<lb />gold leaf. Also, silver is harder and therefore does not
<lb />scratch as easily. <-Q-> And if the gum was not a
<lb />little strong for the silver, the latter would not split so
<lb />neatly. When you work, <-the humid-> the exhalation of your
<lb />breath moistens the leaf laid on the glass, &
<lb />therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times.
<lb />You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank
<lb />& serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not
<lb />quite clean of the gum’s greasiness & viscosity,
<lb /><-the-> & of other things, the colors would not be so neat
<lb />on it. To advance your works, you can pounce, or, better still,
<lb />layer the gum & leaf on a cut paper. In this way, you
<lb />will only need to repair very little. If you want to make gold color

<lb />to render it very uniform, for otherwise the water that would get in
<lb />between would prevent it from becoming uniform. Next, you will press it into
<lb />whatever you want and put three or four pieces of paper on, &
<lb />with a stick <-you-> even & round like a
<lb />pestle, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
<lb />will attach itself to the paper, which will help you lift it off
<lb />the mold. Thus you will imprint better than if you were to cast it
<lb />molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, &
<lb />paint them with colors in varnish, & transfer them onto a
<lb />base of glass painted with colors in turpentine &
<lb />mastic. And if you want to apply these plates by incrustation, do it
<lb />with gum ammoniac  tempered with vinegar, and you will have
<lb />good glue.

<ab>
<lb />For casting in plaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Melt some wax, & with a large brush coat the

<lb />upon which you will cast <-you-> plaster, to give it body
<lb />and strength. Next, in the hollow form of wax, you will also cast your
<lb />plaster in order to have your relief, & it will release very
<lb />easily because of the wax. This is done more for large
<lb />pieces in high relief than for others.

<ab>
<lb />For firing your arquebus precisely, it is necessary that the end
<lb />of the breech be & come precisely to the edge of the touch-hole,
<lb />because in this manner the powder, without blowing, catches &
<lb />burns all at once & has more force & does not push back. On the
<lb />contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the
<lb />powder catches sooner in this place, makes it push back, &
<lb />blows, which a chambered arquebus clearly
<lb />shows, which pushes back more than another. And since the barrel is
<lb />thicker at the breech than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, for
<lb />that at the breech is higher than that at the muzzle. And then, the
<lb />thickness of the barrel gains about one line over the caliber,
<lb />and the sight another. It would therefore be necessary to either
<lb />make the barrel all of one thickness or to raise the stock <-on-> at
<lb />the end & toward the muzzle, & sink it in & lower it
<lb />toward the breech. The weight of the
<lb />powder must be the third part of the ball.

<lb />Loading an arquebus with hail shot
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to make a wooden pipe as long as the width of 4
<lb />or 5 fingers, which should be hollowed precisely according
<lb />to the mouth of your barrel, of the form represented in <-D-> A.
<lb />Then, having cut strong paper, <-of the-> as of large printed
<lb />books, in the form of D, as wide as you want to make your
<lb />cartridge long, wrap the paper
<lb />around the baton B & at the end, where the point F will be,
<lb />fold all around the said paper, & your cartridge will be
<lb />formed. But in order to make the bottom more uniform, put it into
<lb />pipe A, then put in the baton B and, through the other
<lb />end of the pipe, which is marked G, put the baton C
<lb />& beat so as to tamp & press the folded tip of your cartridge,
<lb />then take it out, & load it. Put three or 4
<lb />pieces of shot or
<lb />tears into it. Then, with a
<lb />cutting-punch, marked E, which should be of the same caliber as
<lb />your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on cardboard or
<lb />felt or waxed cloth, and put this round piece into your
<lb />cartridge, and push it onto the pieces of shot with the
<lb />baton B. Next, more pieces of shot, 3 or 4, then a round
<lb />piece. And do thus until the cartridge is full, then put it into your
<lb />arquebus. If you want your hail shot to scatter sooner, make the round
<lb />pieces out of paper. If you want it to reach farther without
<lb />scattering, make the piece out of cardboard. If you want even
<lb />farther, make the round piece out of waxed cloth, or else of
<lb />leather or felt, & a piece of waxed cloth on
<lb />the top. And if you make the cartridge itself of waxed cloth or
<lb />waxed paper, it will reach one hundred paces & will
<lb />make for great piercing, & the hail shot, barely scattering, will
<lb />make an opening. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />But if you make your cartridge with waxed cloth
<lb />or a material stronger than paper, you ought not to make so long
<lb />the part coming from the square to the point as in D, because it is enough
<lb />that it wraps around twice, #. In this manner, the hail
<lb />shot barely scatters & makes for great piercing against a door,
<lb />cuirass body, and others.

<lb />You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
<lb />want to give to your arquebus, all of which should have a screw
<lb />on the end that fits in the nut of the ramrod of the
<lb />said arquebus. Thus, when you have put the powder in the charge,
<lb />which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And
<lb />raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the
<lb />charge is at the bottom of the arquebus, then right the arquebus, the
<lb />mouth of the barrel up, and remove the little ramrod. Thus your
<lb />powder will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or
<lb />dust attaching to the sides of the arquebus, which always has some filth
<lb />in the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more

<lb />string, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the
<lb />place where it does not touch & hit with a hammer on the outside on
<lb />that side & in the same place, & thus it will be righted, &

<lb />basins, the latten of larger ones is brittler than that of
<lb />skillets, because for making the curve of the round so small it is
<lb />necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, to which they give a more
<lb />ample curve of the round, a brittler substance can be taken. In any event,
<lb />the brittlest latten runs better & casts more neatly, but
<lb />let it be cast very <-neat-> hot. <-One-> When one wants

<lb />Extraction of regulus

<ab>
<lb />℞ one lb of antimony, half a lb black
<lb />soap, and half a lb of tartar from
<lb />Montpellier. Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to
<lb />boil in a varnished earthenware pot on a big fire while
<lb />stirring the whole often with a pick of wood or
<lb />iron, & the said soap will be consumed and burn
<lb />off and the rest will stay as if red, and it will be necessary
<lb />that it is reduced by a third. Then one needs to cast it on a
<lb />tile and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four
<lb />or five times and pour it on the flat tile and then you will
<lb />have the regulus drawn from antimony.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Others pulverize the antimony & mix it with
<lb />saltpeter & pulverized tartar, as much of one as of
<lb />the other, &, having heated a pot or crucible
<lb />red hot, they put a little of it at a time, & <-se->

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead, tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They become brittle having been put back to melt often or for a long
<lb />time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts
<lb />a saulmon, the tin thickens at the bottom if, while
<lb />casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt
<lb />little lead <-& the-> or tin &
<lb /><-stir-> to renew it at each melt. The antimony renders
<lb />them breakable. The looking-glass tin whitens them.
<lb /><-One-> Pewterers put in <-on the fine
<lb />tin-> one lb of looking-glass tin per one
<lb />quintal of fine tin & two lb & a half
<lb />or three lb of red & soft cauldron copper, which
<lb />is better than latten. There is fine & soft tin &
<lb />brittle tin. The brittle one is cast in grille
<lb />by the pewterers to sell it better. <-O->
<lb />They come out better & more neatly in stone molds
<lb />than in a copper mold, because copper is fatty
<lb />& sticks unless one heats the mold well or one casts large
<lb />works. Three quarters of lead per one lb of
<lb />soft tin, makes a very liquid line & proper for
<lb />casting, which has a shine like a mirror. Sandiver lightens them.
<lb />And all things that thoroughly lighten metals & remove their
<lb />thickness & dense nature & render them <-like-> liquid
<lb />like water, render them proper for casting, for it is the
<lb />thickness that prevents them from running. Soft tin is
<lb />more even <-com-> than the brittle one, which is
<lb />whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To alloy well tin & lead, one needs to melt one by
<lb />itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
<lb />often on the marble or the square tile.
<lb />And when you will see it become quite even <-like-> & shiny
<lb />as if it were burnished, it is good. For sometimes it becomes spotted
<lb />due to too much lead & sometimes due to too much tin.
<lb />There is some tin which takes more lead than another.

<lb />the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs
<lb />to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
<lb />their molds with a resin candle to cast neatly. The
<lb />antimony makes the substance brittle & breakable. The

<lb />calandra larks. One knows this when they are sad & do not sing.
<lb />One must pierce it <-av->, not with a pin, but
<lb />very gently by turning with the tip of quite pointy feather.
<lb />The calandra lark does not want to be without <-grey->
<lb />river sand, & the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
<lb />& purges itself with it.

<lb />Grain of lead
<lb />        
<lb />Take a <-pierced-> playing card, pierced with a
<lb />pin or needle, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
<lb />the end of a small cleft stick and, holding the said
<lb />stick by <-one end-> the other end,
<lb />put your card three or 4 fingers away from
<lb />the water that you will have put in a dish or similar
<lb />vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too
<lb />hot, into the card & continually tap on the stick
<lb />that holds it. And thus your lead will granulate itself roundly.
<lb />And pass it through a coarse sieve to separate the largest grain
<lb />from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30 paces.

<lb />Birds
<lb />        
<lb />Those that <-can-> are taken at St. Michael are
<lb />good for keeping, but those that are taken in March die,
<lb />because they are starting to fall into love. Ortolans
<lb />are fed on oats all summer in order that they are nourished without becoming
<lb />fat, to be more appropriate for hunting & catching others.
<lb />Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
<lb />millet. They sing at night. One needs to
<lb /><-c-> take them after mid-July until
<lb />St. Michael, for after that time when they have their young in
<lb />this country, they go [<-t->] away like turtledoves do. Siskins
<lb />should also be taken from All Saints’ Day until
<lb />Christmas, for after that they go to the mountains to
<lb />brood.

<lb />Keeping fruit for the entire year
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />℞ a glass ampul with an opening capable of
<lb />receiving cherries and plums or whatever fruit that
<lb />you want. Put in some hot water for the space of two
<lb />hours. And when your water is cooled, throw it out &
<lb />turn the opening upside down on a quite even <-&->
<lb />table, & in a room where there is not a drop of air &
<lb />of wind. Then <-en-> prepare a stopper of new
<lb />wax, wrapped in waxed canvas, and adjust it to the
<lb />ampul quite precisely in order that it will be all ready to
<lb />stop it when you will have put in the fruit. And when you will have
<lb />delicately picked with your hand the fruit without it
<lb />being corrupted & on a warm & dry day, return to the
<lb />well-closed room, where neither wind nor air may enter,
<lb />& put it gently & with dexterity in the bottle. Then
<lb />stop the bottle well with the stopper & lute it
<lb />& making the lute if it seems good with some quicklime &
<lb />oil, & such that no water may enter in. Then put your
<lb />bottles in a vat full of water during the

<lb />a cellar, and in the winter put your bottles
<lb />into a basket furnished with some weights & lower

<lb />Molding

<ab>
<lb />If you want to promptly mold something in half relief that
<lb />comes to hand, fold some paper in five or six doubles,
<lb />& place it on the medal & make sure the
<lb />paper is folded on the back of the medal so
<lb />that it is well secured. Next, take a stick, broad at one end
<lb />& pointed at the other, well smoothed, and rub well on the
<lb />paper, & with the point of the stick retrace
<lb />the lines & proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well
<lb />done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub oil with a
<lb />paintbrush <-lemp-> on the
<lb />paper imprint and cast in tallow or
<lb />wax or sulfur, & the paper, without
<lb />burning, will render your portrait neat, which you will afterward be able to
<lb />mold in plaster or tripoli, and then in
<lb />lead & other metal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Polished carton of little thickness & a little
<lb />moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with
<lb />paper glued on the back.

<lb />Small birds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Ortolans sing at night if they are left
<lb />in the serain, but they are better for fattening for
<lb />fine tables than for singing. Chaffinches are prone to becoming
<lb />blind, & their eyes become swollen at the beginning of
<lb />August. Goldfinches like lettuce seeds very
<lb />much, & often one catches them in gardens on seeded
<lb />lettuces with two lime twigs. But because such regular
<lb />fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
<lb />hemp seed. The passe solitaire is purged
<lb />with a spider, which one needs to give to it
<lb />once a week in order that no
<lb />gaillardisse comes to it. The calandra is purged with dry
<lb />mortar, composed of lime & sand to keep it from
<lb />gaillardise & fattening too much. Young small
<lb />birds are purged with the same dry mortar, by putting some
<lb />pieces in their cages. The cuckoo lays in the nest of
<lb />ortolans otherwise called verdaule.
<lb />This bird is very simple. In the past, I have given leave to two of them,
<lb />which after several days returned to their cage. For feeding
<lb />young goldfinches, one needs to pestle
<lb />almonds with <-pith-> a very little amount
<lb />of bread pith and lettuce seed or
<lb />hemp seed. If it is for linnet, some
<lb />rapeseed.

<lb />Curried steel and files
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The steel that farriers & iron
<lb />workers commonly use is not refined like that from
<lb />Germany or Biscay, which is reduced in hardness
<lb /><-p-> in the bath of molten iron, but
<lb /><-only-> in the iron bars which are transported in flat
<lb />ingots from the forges of Foix & elsewhere,
<lb />there is a harder & whiter & finer kind than the other, as it
<lb />comes from the mine. And the workers choose it
<lb />& use it like the other steel. And because [<-that->] it comes from
<lb />common iron, they call it strong iron. But it is not as
<lb />excellent as purified steel like that from Germany &
<lb />Biscaye, which is sold in small beads. Some curry
<lb />steel, giving it a heating, then temper it <-&
<lb />water-> in a large quantity of water, then forge it.
<lb />& fine steel, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, &
<lb />iron allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate the
<lb />finest steel, <-&-> which with another heating they
<lb />reduce to a mass. The Germans make their files from
<lb />strong iron.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One applies steel to tools
<lb /><-dess-> not on both sides, but underneath the part
<lb />where one sharpens & whets them. & in this part, they must be of
<lb />very soft iron.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Levantines refine our
<lb />steel because their country does not provide them with any. And
<lb />they reheat it in a pot with bitumen, &c.

<lb />paper on it & rub very vigorously across the top with a
<lb />tooth or the bottom of a glass & you will
<lb />transfer your printed piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
<lb />if you oil your paper with spike lavender
<lb /><-&-> or turpentine oil, it will represent
<lb />from the <-left-> right on the other side. Then follow
<lb />these lines with a paintbrush or a quill, then heat the
<lb />paper & the oil will go away & leave your
<lb />paper white. And if you want this not to be known, if by chance,
<lb />you borrowed the piece, moisten the paper, and the polishing that
<lb />the burnisher has made on the back, which shows what has been
<lb />done, will not be known. The soap water will turn the piece
<lb />yellow, but well-gummed water, which has the same effect, does
<lb />not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make gummed
<lb />water, then mix some soap in it & do as is said.

<lb />Cutters of printing plates
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To clean the copper plates, or to make worn ones
<lb />print better, boil them for four or five good hours
<lb />in a good lye quite spent in the wash water. 
<lb />Then make your ink with some linseed
<lb />oil & not with walnut oil & press with the
<lb />rollers. The copper plates are sooner made than
<lb />wood blocks, but they are not so appropriate for
<lb />printing promptly. The wood ones are laborious but also will
<lb />sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other two. To
<lb />carve in wood, the secret is first to poach, that is to say to
<lb />lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the wood block
<lb />& to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
<lb />wood. Once dry, you then gently rub with a moist
<lb />handkerchief the back of the paper which, by rubbing, will
<lb />become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
<lb />one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
<lb />glass & coat with noir d’escaille, to then scrape
<lb />& layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make ink for
<lb />copper plates
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />These rollers are good for promptly printing with cut cartons different kinds of pastes.

<ab>
<lb />One can place the plates among the linen when the

<lb />which is different from that of the printers, one needs
<lb />to boil walnut oil or, even better, linseed
<lb />oil for a long time. & having boiled for a long
<lb />time, you will put in garlic & bread
<lb />crusts to rid it of grease & leave again to boil thoroughly,
<lb />then finally you put in one part of lampblack that you
<lb />have previously ground on marble with oil.
<lb />And finally you will mix everything as long as & until
<lb />you see that the plate prints well. <-Which-> And when
<lb />you have spread the ink on it, wipe the plates well with
<lb />the surface of a piece of white paper. & do this
<lb />until the paper looks clean and then print. If you were
<lb />to wipe the plates with a linen cloth, it would
<lb />remove the ink. Linseed oil thickens while
<lb />boiling & becomes like a varnish & is in danger of
<lb />catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
<lb />open space or in a place where the flame cannot cause
<lb />damage. Some burn tartar until it is black & grind it
<lb />with non-boiled linseed oil, or walnut
<lb />oil which others find to be better. This black is beautiful,
<lb />but the one of lamp smoke is blacker. When you want to print
<lb /><-fr->, take with your fingertip of
<lb />the said black moderately thick, the whole plate having
<lb />first been cleaned in lye as said, then, rub it with the surface
<lb />of a piece of white paper until the
<lb />paper remains white & do not touch it with the
<lb />bare hand <-pourceq-> but with a piece
<lb />of paper applied on top. & having cleaned the
<lb />plate perfectly, <-mi-> rub again with a
<lb />piece of paper, fold the edges & sides. Next, take a
<lb />small even table & on this a piece of
<lb />felt, then a few sheets of paper &
<lb />finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
<lb />two wet napkins. And on this sheet put your
<lb />plate then another piece of paper, &
<lb />finally another felt. Then pass between the
<lb />rollers. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
<lb />always charging the plate with ink & cleaning it as you
<lb />have done. But if you desist from printing, the rest of the ink will dry
<lb />in the grooves of the plate. Thus you will have to boil it
<lb />in lye or urine, as already said, to clean it. The
<lb />rollers must not be too loose.

<lb />The work done in Algiers
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a colt of three or 4 years & feed it on
<lb /><-rye-> barley & straw
<lb /><-pig-> cut in the manner one feeds horses in
<lb />Spain, and water it with good fountain or river
<lb />water. I do not know if it would be good to water it
<lb />occasionally with water of sulfurous baths, & to sometimes
<lb />give it fenugreek or other hot foods, for the intention
<lb />of the worker is <-to it-> to use the heat of its
<lb />dung, & the climate here is cooler than that of
<lb />Algiers. Keep it in a warm & close place &
<lb />so that none of its dung & urine should be lost, of
<lb />which you will make a heap or two in order that while one cools, the
<lb />other will be at the appropriate heat to continue. Also take a large
<lb />glass mattras, as thick as you can, & one
<lb />finger thick if it can be done, & of the
<lb />capacity of one pitcher or earthen
<lb />jug. Around the feast of St. John, put into
<lb />it a dozen & a half chicken eggs, that is to say, the
<lb />yolk without the glair & the (germ) see). Others
<lb />say lx yolks. And <-it will be-> with this dozen & a
<lb />half egg yolks put in half an ounce (others say for lx
<lb />eggs half a lb) of female silkworm
<lb />seeds. And after having luted the
<lb />mattras well (I do not know if it is at all necessary for the
<lb />generation that there be air), put it & bury it in the heat of the dung up to
<lb />the neck, and leave it there until several <-f[illegible]->
<lb />worms are engendered. And then remove the mattras
<lb />& do not bury it in the dung any longer, but only keep it
<lb />placed on the hot <-x-> layer of the dung
<lb />until all the worms will have eaten & consumed one
<lb /><-d-> another, bustling & stirring, and only one
<lb />remains. When this is the case you need to feed it at regular
<lb />intervals, day & night, with the aid of two men, who by
<lb />intervals will take care of it, and you will feed it with an egg
<lb />yolk covered with a gold leaf, or with a liquid egg
<lb />yolk with the gold leaf incorporated; & take good care
<lb />that it does not want for such food (some say one egg yolk per
<lb />hour, others three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the
<lb />practice). Nourished in this way it will achieve its growth in two
<lb />months or seven weeks & will become like a
<lb />snake, one empan & 4
<lb />fingers long, & one lb in weight, and as
<lb />its wings begin to grow, one will need to put it to death by making
<lb />a ring of charcoal fire around the bottle one
<lb />empan distant from it, and then stopper &
<lb />lute the bottle well in order that it does not
<lb />exhale.

<lb />Or to be safer, retire from there until the fire has died down &

<lb />dangerous. And for the occasion when you
<lb />feed it with pincers,
<lb /><-b-> wash your mouth with good vinegar
<lb />& take some preservative & plug yourself up well. Once it is
<lb />dead, put it in a linen cloth or a canvas of silk &
<lb />fold it & hang it from the ceiling, where the air
<lb /><-or-> & sun dry it. Once it is quite dry,
<lb />pulverize it in a mortar. And keep this powder carefully,
<lb />because one ℥ of this thrown on iii lb of molten
<lb />♁ reduces it to finer ☉ than the other one. But it does not
<lb />have as much  weight. For this work you also
<lb />need to choose the oldest ♁ that you can, which has often been
<lb />melted & finely hammered into sheets or other works, & purify it
<lb />before by melting & throwing it into honey &
<lb />vinegar. The term of the work is nine months from

<lb />Linseed
</ab>

<lb />perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &
<lb />breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
<lb />third.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Colors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to keep them beautiful in gum and such that they
<lb />do not lose any of their true color, put white wine, the
<lb />whitest and clearest you can, in a bottle with a little
<lb />tragacanth gum. And having stoppered the
<lb />bottle, scramble & shake it very strongly together, &
<lb />let it rest until the tragacanth is dissolved. Also put in a
<lb />little fine-grained white salt to brighten the whole.
<lb />Some mix clear water with white wine, and with this
<lb />mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
<lb />beautifully in illumination work.

<lb />Silkworms

<ab>
<lb />They are produced from seed, that is to say eggs, that which is sold
<lb />by the ounce, which is commonly sold in Languedoc iii
<lb />lb v s. The one from Spain that
<lb />merchants bring there is considered the best because the
<lb />worms which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
<lb />& make more silk. In Spain, from one ounce of
<lb /><-silk-> seed, worms are produced from it which
<lb />commonly yield <-ord-> xv lb of silk.
<lb />But <-the ounce-> from one ounce of seed
<lb />produced in France, only x or xii come out of it. Three
<lb />ounces of seed are for producing such a quantity of
<lb />worms, that with them you will be able to furnish a room
<lb />accomodated with three or 4 levels of large shelves. Willingly
<lb />they begin to molt around Holy Week. And to do
<lb />this, one puts them in a fir box, like those where one
<lb />puts sweetmeats, warmly among feather cushions. And at the
<lb />beginning, they molt like <-f-> little
<lb />black ants, & as soon as there are two or three molted,
<lb />one needs to give them white mulberry leaves.

<lb />And then
<lb />arrange them on the shelves. And three times per
<lb />day, one needs to exchange fresh leaves. And if
<lb />during the day there is some thunder or rainy
<lb />weather, cloud-covered & cool, one needs to keep in the
<lb />room three or 4 chafing dishes <-&-> with
<lb />glowing charcoal, & put in incense until all the
<lb />room would be filled with smoke. And when the
<lb />weather is warm & serain, the silk abounds
<lb />more & is all the better for it. Some worms make it whiter,
<lb />others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
<lb />draws it with hot water. <-From->
<lb />The worms, from their birth until u the <-their->
<lb />time when they make their cocoons & their prisons, sleep &
<lb />rest 4 times, & each time remain 4 or five days
<lb />resting without eating, as if they were dying to be reborn again,
<lb />for each time they change skin & begin by molting from the head then
<lb />consequently, on different days, the <-s->
<lb />rest of the body, & from white turn grayish, & from grayish to
<lb />white. <-Finally-> And if one of them has some illness
<lb />who does not have the strength to molt, one needs to help it &
<lb />be careful not to break it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
<lb />no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
<lb />handled it with the hand. Around Pentecost,
<lb />they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of heath or

<lb />on some of the high shelves, & at that time, one knows
<lb />when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
<lb /><-hau-> lengthen & raise the head & a part of
<lb />the body. At that time one carries them to the heath branches
<lb />where they stop & begin to spin their prison, which one calls
<lb />cocoon, commonly the size of a pigeon egg, although
<lb />one finds much larger ones because it sometimes happens that two or
<lb />three & up to xi worms are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
<lb />& downy all around, <-&-> the hair of which is
<lb />ferret-silk or floret; & from the
<lb />cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous & firm skin, silk
<lb />is made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty
<lb />with a fingernail. And nevertheless, to leave its
<lb />prison, <-it-> the worm gnaws it at one end,
<lb />& after having stayed inside living on its own sap
<lb /><-it-> for three weeks, it comes
<lb />out, diminished by half. For when it begins to spin, it is
<lb />as long as a ring finger & has eight feet, &
<lb />coming out it is shorter by half & only has 4 feet. On the
<lb />other hand, it has become a butterfly & has wings, without, however,
<lb />flying. And there are male & female. As soon as they come
<lb />out of the cocoon, the male charges the female & one puts them on a
<lb />white linen, where they make their eggs, which the female would not
<lb />make well & profitably if the male was not given to her. And when the
<lb />male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it out, for it
<lb />would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
<lb />& making their eggs in three weeks &
<lb />around St. John’s Day. And at that time one keeps
<lb />their eggs & seed until Holy Week, as
<lb /><-on-> is said. Some spin among the leaves & make
<lb />their cocoon there without climbing high.

<lb />[On dry preserves]
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To dry preserves <-take a-> which are not liquid, take an
<lb />open tub pierced on both sides with a small, square window,
<lb />& pass sticks through these on one side and the other,
<lb />& place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a
<lb />net. And on this, you will properly arrange the vessels with your
<lb />preserves. And having put at the bottom of the tub a
<lb />chafing-dish or two, cover the tub with a
<lb />bedsheet folded double.

<lb />For casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Chalk most recently taken from the quarry is good
<lb />for lead. One ought neither to wet nor grind it, but render it subtle by
<lb />pestling or scraping & passing through a sieve. Thus for pumice,
<lb />which one ought not to grind with water, nor corrupt its nature. 
<lb />Lead should be but little mixed with tin,
<lb />only for giving it strength, and two parts
<lb /><-of tin for-> lead for <-of-> one of
<lb />tin or more.

<lb />Excellent tempering bath for cuirass bodies
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take river water, as clear & running as
<lb />possible, & heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch
<lb />of weld, & take the grain of it & put it into
<lb />the said water & boil it thoroughly, stirring it with a stick, then pour it into a
<lb />muid or other vessel, then throw into it two
<lb />pecks of salt. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Next, take a big cauldron of the said
<lb />river water & heat it to a litte more than
<lb />tepid. & take three or four double handfuls of
<lb />fatty red earth, soak it & throw it into the cauldron
<lb />with the said water. Take as much pigeon dung
<lb />as the said earth, & as much horse
<lb />dung, & as much iron filings, & mix the
<lb />whole separately, & throw it into the cauldron & leave
<lb />it for two or three days. Then throw it afterward
<lb />into the said muid and stir the whole thoroughly together. And
<lb />the older this temper is, the better it will be.

<ab>
<lb />Varnish for distemper
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can make marble with distemper of lake or
<lb />rose of Ghent & chalk. Once dry, glaze with
<lb />lake tempered in wine, for the glue makes it die &
<lb />blacken. And all will appear red, but the varnish you will
<lb />put here, which will penetrate, will make appear dark & light
<lb />that which ought to be thus. The varnish is made thus, mix with clear
<lb />Venice turpentine some spike lavender oil
<lb /><-&-> until all is clear & liquid enough, & it is done
<lb />without fire. This one <-es-> is for things in
<lb />distemper, and the turpentine varnish that you know, for
<lb />panels. Pure spike lavender oil varnish is not good for
<lb />panels, for spike lavender oil is too penetrating &
<lb />makes colors sparkle, unless it was made long ago.

<lb />All marble on which a knife can prick is
<lb />worth nothing for grinding fine colors.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Chalk has no body in oil. Ceruse is
<lb />appropriate. But lead white more excellent. Ceruse is the
<lb />whitest, when ground first in water, the lead white
<lb />grayish. But <-the white-> it takes on its perfect whiteness in
<lb />oil.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you grind your colors, first clean your workshop
<lb />well, for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will damage your
<lb />colors, which will never be beautiful if they are not very
<lb /><-be-> clean.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Florey must not be mixed with azur d’esmail
<lb />or another, for it makes it green.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For palettes to paint, ivory is excellent, knots
<lb />of the fir tree, the pear tree, & if it
<lb />is a walnut tree, make sure the grain of the wood
<lb />runs lengthwise.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-L-> One always needs to apply imprimatura
<lb /><-d->on wood to paint there in oil in
<lb />order to fill the holes & unevenness, and make imprimatura with some stil de
<lb />grain yellow & ceruse tempered in oil, then soften
<lb />with a feather, which flattens better than a
<lb />paintbrush. Or when the imprimatura is dry, scrape strongly
<lb />with a knife.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To use azur d’esmail in oil, one needs to
<lb />choose the most delicate. And to render it subtle, one ought not to grind it,
<lb />for this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, & the coarsest
<lb />going to the bottom, choose the one that is above in the
<lb />water or, by inclination, pour out the cloudy water, then
<lb />gather the azure.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    The one who makes a profession of working in
<lb />oil will hardly work well in distemper if he has not
<lb />been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different,
<lb />because when washing the paintbrush for distemper,
<lb />one always leaves it humid. And on the contrary, when one cleans the
<lb />paintbrush in oil to soften, one wipes the
<lb />paintbrush well. Otherwise, the work would run &
<lb />would soon be all disfigured.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The Italians soften by hatching with a large flattened
<lb />paintbrush which makes serrations.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the Flemish,
<lb />but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker
<lb />next & finally a little blacker to better make project & come
<lb />out.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In distemper do not mix your different colors together
<lb /><-But->, for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in
<lb />order that they do not dry & that you have time to soften, moisten
<lb />the back of the canvas.

<lb />Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must
<lb />grind some glass with it. But one needs to choose cristallin
<lb />because it is cleaner. And because it would be too difficult to grind by
<lb />itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it
<lb />into cold water, & it will crumble & pulverize
<lb />easily for grinding it afterward. Being well ground <-it-> with a lot of
<lb />water, it resembles ground lead white, but for all this it has
<lb />no body. I think it would be good for casting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead white is made with plate lead, beaten thin & put
<lb />under the dung heap.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />White varnish of turpentine or of spike lavender
<lb />oil and turpentine is colored with pulverized
<lb />terra emerita, making it boil together. It gives a gold
<lb />color on silver and more beautiful if it is burnished. It is dry
<lb />in a quarter of an hour. Aloe would make brighter
<lb />color still, but it takes long to dry & the other is dry in a quarter
<lb />of an hour, in winter as well as
<lb />summer.

<lb />If you make a layer of printers’ ink on velvet
<lb />and there apply gold leaf and then stretch the velvet, it

<lb />Vermilion ground by itself is wan and pale, but ground after
<lb />lake, it is more beautiful.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For ridding marbles of grease, one grinds
<lb />common ashes on it, which is good afterward to make the first
<lb />imprimatura of a panel that is prepared in oil in order to seal
<lb />the cracks & chinks of the wood. It has more body than
<lb />chalk & it has <-chalk-> a certain fattiness.
<lb />One mixes it with the said chalk or <-ra->
<lb />with the colors collected from the vessel where one cleans the
<lb />paintbrush. It is desiccative and spares the color.
<lb /><-On-> Once this first imprimatura is made on the wood, one
<lb />scrapes with a knife to even it. Next, one makes there a second imprimatura
<lb />of ceruse or of the meanest colors mixed together. In
<lb />a painting in oil on canvas, one applies only
<lb />one imprimatura, and the same ashes can be used there. Also, after one
<lb />has ground a color, one grinds some pith of coarse bread on it to
<lb />rid the marble of grease.

<lb />Sheath maker
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sheath makers use small, very delicate skins of
<lb />lambs and young goats, almost like
<lb />parchment and keep them constantly re-moistened in humid
<lb />places. When they want to imprint some history, they layer them in
<lb />the hollows of their figure, then put over the top fine fatty
<lb />earth with which cloths are rid of grease, having pressed & beaten
<lb />it well & rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on
<lb />the earth a small even board and put the whole in a
<lb />press and let it dry there. After the
<lb />earth, only the leather remains neatly imprinted  of
<lb />the size of a pea. And then you give the
<lb />leather two or three layers of copperas black and
<lb />iron scale, one after the other, as even as the
<lb />tanners do. And this dye, being astringent, makes the
<lb />leather shrink & strengthens it and makes it imprint better.
<lb />Once dry, one glues canvas on the back with strong glue. 
<lb />In this manner one can promptly imitate big statues &
<lb />very subtle medals and paint &
<lb />decorate them & are light and portable
<lb />& last a long time. That which is imprinted on a relief
<lb />is done differently and can be retraced with a hot
<lb />iron.

<lb />The Flemish do not use any whites for flesh colors in

<lb />yellow.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />4- or 5-year-old walnut oil which is clear
<lb />is the best color, it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been
<lb />drawn with the press in the manner of almond oil is
<lb />white, especially if the walnuts’ skin is removed.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f114" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> One needs to make at least three layers of flesh color to accomplish
<lb />faces in oil. And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber
<lb />where it is appropriate. Next, the [<-c->] heightening with lead
<lb />white must not be put on the black. Flesh colors, and  where the
<lb />ceruse enters will yellow in five or six months, but
<lb />lead white does not change.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Florence lake is better than that from
<lb />Flanders for in Florence the best dyes are made. To
<lb />make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest & liveliest lake is
<lb />the best, for the kind that contains purple &
<lb />violet, by admixture of too much alum, makes flesh color like
<lb />that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their
<lb />cheeks, grind Florence lake very finely, then
<lb />fill a little cotton with it, which they next
<lb />wrap in a little fabric of Cambray which is
<lb />clear. And thus they pounce the lake on their cheeks
<lb />& then, with another clean cotton, they
<lb />soften it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cristallin having been ground with water
<lb />appears to <-be-> have body, but with oil it does not have
<lb />any. It is ground with lake & with asphaltum, which
<lb />would not dry for a very long time without this.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spike lavender oil is commonly put with lead
<lb />white, <-d-> not entirely pure but mixed with a
<lb />little walnut oil. The said spike lavender
<lb />oil would not be good for lake & colors that do not have
<lb />body, for it would make them glitter, but with those that have
<lb />body & are somewhat fatty, it is quite appropriate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Verdigris and orpiment must first be ground with
<lb />urine before thinning them with oil. Thus they are

<lb />Azure is not good here, but wan, & one needs to work
<lb />with long paintbrushes. Fresco is not used
<lb />    <-cont-> on wood.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Turpentine oil renders it very beautiful. Test palma christi seed oil.
<lb />Walnut oil in Flanders costs at least a hundred
<lb />sous a pint. The azure requires a little
<lb />fatty oil because it has no body.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azur d’esmail hates more than any other to be ground,
<lb />especially with water, for it dies & loses all its color.
<lb />However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
<lb />water but with oil & grind it thickly, and in this
<lb />way it will not die as much.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Always choose the most delicate one.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Paintbrushes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak
<lb />them in spike lavender oil and they immediately will
<lb />turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in
<lb />walnut oil. Walnut oil is not <-as
<lb />not-> as appropriate to soften them as that of spike
<lb />lavender, which is clear like water & penetrates
<lb />& does not have body like walnut oil. The handle
<lb />of paintbrushes is made by those who work with
<lb />care from porcupine quills,
<lb />by others from wood of arrows from Turkey
<lb /><-with whom-> with which they also make small rods to rest
<lb />their hand when they are painting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To work well on a small scale very thin paintbrushes which
<lb />have a firm point [<-z->] are<-on-> needed. And because a 
<lb />squirrel’s tail hair is soft,
<lb />the most careful take the bristles of the oldest rats,
<lb />especially of dormice if they can find them, & put two or
<lb />three of them in the middle of the paintbrush. These make
<lb />a straight line like a quill & all the other
<lb />hairs
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />of the paintbrush stick to them as to the
<lb />point. The bristles of beech martens & weasels
<lb />& small animals that make musk are even better, for a
<lb />single hair in a paintbrush suffices.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f116" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lake & lead white & ceruse are easy to
<lb />work in oil, but every kind of azure is difficult. And to
<lb />make beautiful azure, one needs to layer it not with large
<lb />strokes of the paintbrush but with small strokes of the
<lb />point. Not only ash &
<lb />azur d’Acre but mainly azur d’esmail
<lb />which one needs to choose to be very delicate. <-For it->
<lb />Otherwise you will not <-v-> be able to work with it
<lb />except with much work, and even then you need to allay it with
<lb />turpentine to give it body, and mix it with a little lead
<lb />white. Any azure wants neither to be ground nor washed for it
<lb />loses color & becomes pale. But putting it powdered on your
<lb />palette, you will thin it little by little either with
<lb />walnut oil or turpentine oil,
<lb />dipping a knife point in the oil, then
<lb />tempering it little by little on the said
<lb />palette.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Shadows
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear &
<lb />thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to give relief
<lb />well. The Italians commonly make three shadows, the first one,
<lb />of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite
<lb />strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from
<lb />the darkest to the clearest.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The varnish is more beautiful on the panel when the color has
<lb />imbibed well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel
<lb /><-without-> with walnut oil with which it has
<lb />been first thinned, without putting in spike lavender
<lb />oil. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will
<lb />not shine, thus appearing to be well-imbibed. If not, it will shine.
</ab>

<lb />Azur d’esmail <-imbibed in oil-> tempered
<lb />in oil, leaves it & returns to its primary nature if you mix it
<lb />in water.

<lb /><-Black-> Painting of armor
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Charcoal black mixed with a little lead white is very
<lb />appropriate to make armor, mixing in a little <-of [illegible]->
<lb />azure if you wish. Charcoal black by itself is
<lb />as if bluish.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Painting of crêpe
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First one needs to make the background greyish with charcoal
<lb />black mixed with lead white & a little azure,
<lb />then <-resu-> after it is dry, heighten with strokes
<lb />& lines in lead white.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Folds in clothing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In this, one needs to take care that none are made false, but that
<lb />only that which the natural can do is imitated. A thick cloth
<lb />hardly makes any folds, taffetas & silk cloth make
<lb />more, & crêpe more still. <-Make-> Heed which ones
<lb />should go lengthwise & others across.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Desiccative
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead white & massicot are the most desiccative,
<lb />nevertheless they need a good two days. If you want
<lb />to prove whether an oil is desiccative, temper lead white
<lb />with it, & if it produces a crust <-in a
<lb />day-> soon it means that it will dessicate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Double layers
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azures, flesh colors, & reds are layered twice. The others
<lb />not.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mending the cracks in a panel
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the
<lb />reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &
<lb />repair it, it ought not to be with glue, which rots in humid
<lb />weather & would swell when touched with the oil of the
<lb />painting. But take white wax, which is harder than the other.
<lb />The oil mixed in among the wax prevents it from
<lb />melting in the sun. The wax ought not to be hard, but
<lb />soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks & crevices with the
<lb />tip of a knife, then scrape;
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f118" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />and to prevent it from breaking, mix in little oil &
<lb />melt them together & fill the cracks & make them even and paint
<lb />on them. And the oil mixed with wax will
<lb /><-q-> better receive color, which is also
<lb />tempered with oil.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First whitening of a panel
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One layers two or three times with chalk tempered with
<lb />distemper glue on the panel, not with a
<lb />paintbrush but with a brush in such a
<lb />way as if you wanted to pounce, & leave to dry. And reiterate up to
<lb />two or three times, then even out the last ground well with a
<lb />knife, then give a coat of glue on top, upon
<lb />which you will next be able to make your imprimatura and then paint. But
<lb />make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break
<lb />easily. Flemish painters have such panels
<lb />made by the dozen.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Neat work
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, & when you
<lb />leave your work, cover it in order that the said dust will not fall upon it.
<lb />Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you
<lb />will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white
<lb />on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, & thus with the
<lb />others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color.
<lb /><-Ains-> In this way, layering each manner of color
<lb />on the imprimatura itself, they will not die & you will work
<lb />neatly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    Oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Walnut oil extracted like peeled
<lb />almonds is very white. The one of palmachristi. And when the oil has a little body, the
<lb />colors soften in it. For if the oil is too clear, the colors run &
<lb />do not have bond, even those that hardly have any body. Fatty
<lb />oil that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for varnish.
<lb />The oil is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as
<lb />common varnish. Oils do not dry as quickly in cold
<lb />countries as in hot countries. Oil exposed to the sun
<lb />is clarified well. But it fattens, if you put in ceruse or
<lb />lead filings or lead white or calcined pulverized
<lb /><-p-> glass. To avoid this, put the vial in
<lb />clear water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Colors in oil, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the
<lb />second colors; to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will
<lb />take there.

<lb />Which one knows when, being placed on a knife in the

<lb />Cleaning panels
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some clean them with soapy water, others with urine,
<lb />others with white wine, for dust spoils the colors.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spike lavender oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to put any into colors for it is so brisk and
<lb />penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for
<lb />this reason, painters use it to clean their oil
<lb />paintbrush when they have become hard, for it renders them
<lb />soft & clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts
<lb />them. Also, painters, sometimes envious of the work
<lb />undertaken by another, in the evening secretly pour a few
<lb />drops of spike lavender <-on the-> oil on the top
<lb />edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that
<lb />penetrates as far as the wood & makes the colors come off such
<lb />that, to make the work even & of an equal composition, they are
<lb />forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.

<lb />Work of the Flemish
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They do all their works in oil with the tip of the
<lb />paintbrushes, in <-f-> the fashion of good
<lb />illuminators, and grind their colors very finely, protect
<lb />against dust, and often clean from their paintbrush the
<lb />bits of hair which they sometimes leave there, for if these
<lb />should remain on the work <-it this->, it would prevent neat
<lb />working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work
<lb />appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply
<lb />more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They
<lb />usually finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose,
<lb />finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others
<lb />who <-fo-> layer two or three different flesh colors, one
<lb />yellowish & the other darker, because the colors always mix &
<lb />finally die. They simply <-[illegible]-> make their imprimatura
<lb />properly,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f120" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />and even it well, <-then-> and once quite dry, they draw their
<lb />portrait & layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for
<lb />shadow, like the side of the forehead & the cheek, & the area
<lb />around the eyes blank & dry until they have filled in the rest. Next
<lb />they put their shadows separately, which they do not make so dark, but rather
<lb />that which the natural can make. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh
<lb />color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white & black on black,
<lb /><-Thus-> & each on their own. In this way their work is neat
<lb />& the colors do not die.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Flesh colors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main
<lb />layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And
<lb />then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the principal lights
<lb />with a little lead white. But avoid putting too much of it for
<lb />this will make it look like a face of death. The beautiful
<lb />Florence lake makes a beautiful <-re-> vivid flesh color
<lb />approaching <-[illegible]-> the tint of rose
<lb />alexandrine & incarnadine.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Certain colors do not want to be ground, like minium and
<lb />massicot. The ashes do not want to be ground at all.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Rounding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to model relief well, <-arr-> soften round
<lb />things by rounding them with the point of the paintbrush
<lb />& the rest with the flat part if it is flat, & thus for the
<lb />others according to their nature, & lightly with the point of
<lb />the dry & flattened paintbrush & with
<lb />patience.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead white
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Without this, you cannot work on a small scale, for which one needs
<lb />to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with ceruse
<lb />because it does not have enough body.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lights
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Your paintbrush shows it to you by casting a shadow
<lb />which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a
<lb />straight line like this
<lb />,
<lb />for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as
<lb />if at an incline, thus
<lb />.
<lb />It is necessary that the panel not be facing the
<lb />light head-on, but half turned
<lb />against it. And above all look for soft light, for it makes soft both
<lb />the shadow & the work, as a harsh light a harsh
<lb />work.

<lb />Frames of the Germans 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Germans who work in miniature make frames not of
<lb />glass, but of canvas anointed with clear turpentine
<lb />varnish, namely half turpentine oil & almost
<lb />half turpentine, because this light, which is not as bright
<lb />as from glass, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
<lb />to make something subtle like veins <-de-> & similar
<lb />things, they use paintbrushes composed of two or three
<lb />rat whiskers.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azur d’esmail in oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to choose the most <-beautiful-> delicate that
<lb />will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
<lb />oil. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
<lb />grind it well, not with water but with oil, & grind it
<lb />thickly. Next lay it on your palette & mix in a little
<lb />turpentine, but hardly any, to give it bond, and make it so that it is
<lb />thick like butter or mortar, & then, with a fairly
<lb />large paintbrush, work it by always moving the
<lb />paintbrush back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
<lb />across it in a tooth-like jagging with <-the-> the tip of the
<lb />paintbrush. The highlights will be made with
<lb /><-d-> the same thinned with ceruse,
<lb />which, giving it bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
<lb />thus. It must be very thick, & almost such that you are at pains to
<lb />spread it with the paintbrush. And it is all the better
<lb />if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
<lb />is very subtle & thin without being ground, and does not run.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure wants to be layered neatly, which is why
<lb /><-quan-> it always dies somewhat when, to mend an old panel,
<lb />one layers it on old, already tarnished azure. In such
<lb />matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer & apply imprimatura again,
<lb />then put down the azure. It is almost thus for other colors.
<lb />Also, azure ground with oil always remains shiny, which is
<lb />not a good sign for azure, for this makes it die.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Grinding colors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />A slab of <-marble & p-> glass a

<lb />than anything else for grinding colors neatly, especially for

<lb />Perspectives
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Perspectives in oil take a long time because of
<lb />several lines that need to be done with a ruler, and for this
<lb />reason one usually does them in distemper. One takes the points
<lb />at one’s discretion. The main thing in this lies in having the knowledge
<lb />of the point. One commonly makes two or three of them, sometimes
<lb />five.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is put for faces, hair, skulls, and rocks.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Distant people and animals
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One first does them roughly in gray or in purple, which is made of
<lb />azure
<lb />ash & lake. Once dry, one heightens & finishes with flesh color & other
<lb />colors & with white. And it
<lb />looks better & is sooner
<lb />done than with white & with
<lb />black.
<lb />Armies
<lb />are painted
<lb />thus.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Drawing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />After you have applied imprimatura to your panel & scraped with a knife
<lb />to render it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest piece
<lb />of charcoal you can find, for with a short one you would
<lb />not see your line so well & would do it roughly. Let the tip of
<lb />the charcoal be thin, & in order not to render it
<lb />dull & blunt soon, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly
<lb />sharpen it. Also, hold your charcoal as far at the end
<lb />as you can, <-& do it-> & accustom yourself
<lb /><-af-> to make a light line. For if you accustom yourself
<lb />to drawing delicately with charcoal, you will do
<lb />likewise with colors. And he who is rough
<lb />with charcoal is never exquisite with colors. And by a
<lb />line of charcoal, masters pass judgment on their
<lb />apprentices. First make the outline of your drawing, that is
<lb />the contour, lightly & without any too careful work, but boldly. In
<lb />so doing, you will teach yourself to be an artist, and if you
<lb />need to undo anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had
<lb />elaborated it. Next, re-work all the distinctive lines, & do not keep
<lb />too close to your panel, but occasionally step away from it to better
<lb />judge the proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace
<lb />all the lines with the paintbrush in rose color or
<lb />another color in gum or distemper. Thus you will work more
<lb />confidently with colors, and with less effort.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Drawing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To become an artist, one needs to draw by
<lb />eye, without compass or ruler.
<lb />Masters do not allow apprentices to do this.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the imprimatura has been long done, it becomes greasy.
<lb />One needs to rub it with ash & water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Perspective
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To know the point, one needs to lay down a ruler over the
<lb />lines, & at the intersection of these, the point will
<lb />be. Some make a hole at the end of their
<lb />rulers to fix the point by that hole & move the
<lb />ruler about. Others lay down a ruler across the panel,
<lb />then on this laid-down ruler they set the tip of another
<lb />ruler, which, attached to the former by means of a screw,
<lb />moves about & reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.
<lb />    
<lb />The ruler and compass without the judgment of the
<lb />eye cause errors.
<lb />Perspective is very difficult.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To paint perspective in oil, you ought not to use a
<lb />ruler, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
<lb />colors you need to keep to <-the-> & follow the lines of your
<lb />first drawing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To make plumb lines also, which go from the top
<lb /><-to make-> <-vif-> to the bottom of the panel,
<lb />you need to have a thread with some piece of lead
<lb />attached to one end & a little hook to the other for
<lb />hanging the said thread from the top of the panel.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Panel
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To draw & to layer the colors, especially in oil, it is necessary that you
<lb />hold your panel as upright as you can on the easel, for if
<lb />it is slanted there is a danger that some dust & dirt might stick on
<lb />it. Keep clean & without dust the place where you paint.

<lb />Although it is said to be immortal, it is nonetheless the case that
<lb />white wine removes its tint & turns claret-colored, <-on-> & the dry flower ends up white afterward. Note that in this way the
<lb />wine, & I have <-p-> tested it. Eau-de-vie does as much.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Drying of oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the oil does not dry out, put in massicot &
<lb />minium. There is no better oil than that of walnut, for
<lb />it dries out neither too soon nor too late.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The Germans use lead from Flanders because
<lb />it is very soft. And to cast better they take lead ore & melt
<lb />it, & separate what is melted from the filth &
<lb />ore, & pour it into a separate vessel, then <-the
<lb />bottom-> they make their cast with it. For the lead must not have been
<lb />put to work before, but rather completely new. Some cast into molds
<lb />of iron & copper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />or new lead coming from the mine. They melt it twice
<lb />in a crucible. In the first one, they purge it of
<lb />filth. In the second, they <-en-> make the cast.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Shadows
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />German painters make their shadows on flesh
<lb />color of men with ground jet, stil de grain yellow
<lb />& ocher.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Bistre

<lb />It is only used in distemper, & with this wood color is

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Verdigris and another very beautiful bright green
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to grind it with water alone, for that makes it
<lb />die. To render it beautiful in distemper, some grind it with
<lb />vinegar, but that makes it turn pale & become whitish. To
<lb />render it beautiful, grind it with urine & leave to dry.
<lb />Then, whenever you like, grind it with oil. And after you have
<lb />collected it with the spatula, before finishing to clean the
<lb />marble, grind stil de grain yellow on it. And you
<lb />will have a very beautiful green.

<lb />One needs [<-needs->] to make the<-e-> <-middle-> 
<lb />main layer very <-d-> dark, & its folds & highlights
<lb />very bright with white, & on the edges of<-u-> its light, you make a white
<lb />line. For blue & green velvets, you <-highlight->
<lb />touch the shading with peach pit black, which is very
<lb />black. For lake, black of pit coal which
<lb />makes a reddish black on lake for velvets. The
<lb />common charcoal makes a whitish black. <-P->

<lb />If you have worked & made your ground with some

<lb />day, it would be dry & you would not be able to finish it

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Working neatly
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Never put down, if you can, two colors one on top of the other. But
<lb />next, having made your design carefully, keep the place of shadows for
<lb />them alone, & also separately that of lights & highlights,
<lb />without layering one color all over & then highlighting or else shading
<lb />on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colors
<lb />& work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
<lb />muddled nor mixed together, they do not die & you soften the colors
<lb />better, since they are not so thick.

<lb />Vermilion
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to keep it in water when <-tempered->
<lb />ground with oil for it loses its color. It is better
<lb />to choose whitish vermilion than dark & blackish. For
<lb />vermilion is commonly mixed with a little lake, without
<lb />which it would hardly be different from minium. But the pale 
<lb />casts more vivacity than the dark. It is not desiccative, &
<lb />for this reason one mixes in calcined cristallin.

<lb />Oil colors in water
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Commonly, after grinding them one puts a [<-e->]
<lb /><-fo-> piece of tin leaf on top, & one puts
<lb />them in water to prevent them from drying out. But this is more
<lb />appropriate for ceruse, lead white, minium, &
<lb />massicot than for the others, for lake dies there &
<lb />loses its color, also azure, vermilion.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Double layer
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Verdigris does not die, & thus does not need
<lb />to be layered twice. But lake & others, & principally
<lb />flesh colors, <-the-> require two layers. Colors hardly change
<lb />when they are dry.

<lb />Apprenticeship of the painter
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First, one gives him an egg to do in which one has him make
<lb />half a face, then a whole one with the ears, next the neck, then the
<lb />parts of the body separately, next joined, then one figure, then two
<lb />& three, finally a history, teaching him how to hold the
<lb />charcoal by the end, & also the paintbrush.
<lb />Once he knows how to draw, one teaches him how to <-p-> layer colors.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One also presents him with these strokes & lines.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-C->The figure of the egg is the
<lb />main pattern for faces and for bent bodies, <-& the cross-> as the cross is
<lb />the model for a straight & whole figure.
<lb />Without these strokes you will never do well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Softening
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To soften well, one ought not to layer the colors thickly, but
<lb />rather layer them twice, if it is not azur d’esmail.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All colors that have no body
<lb />in oil have none in distemper, <-and->
<lb />but in distemper they sink to the bottom.
<lb />Distemper colors want to be fatty,
<lb />which is recognized when they take hold
<lb />on the palette
<lb />once tempered
<lb />in oil.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Straight lines
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can use the ruler, but do not lay it flat on the panel,
<lb />but as if lifted off, & resting on the edges of the panel. Otherwise
<lb />you would smudge everything, & also you would not see the stroke
<lb />well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Distemper
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Distemper colors need to be kept darker
<lb /><-pr-> while you temper them, because they whiten
<lb />while drying. But oil colors remain the same color.

<lb />Shadows
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Because blacks make different colors, some a reddish black, others
<lb />tending toward blue, and others toward green, choose those which tend
<lb />toward yellow to make beautiful shadows in oil, for the shadow,
<lb />especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
<lb />strongly ground jet, which you will mix with a little
<lb />yellow ocher & lead white. Or else, after
<lb />you have ground your lead white <-bro-> and
<lb /><-clean p-> gathered it with the 
<lb />, grind the jet into it. Thus it will be more
<lb />desiccative, & making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
<lb />mixed in renders it perfect for men’s shadows. Blacks which make a
<lb />greenish black are appropriate for women’s shadows. Take, then, some
<lb />black of , a little sap green & bistre, &
<lb />you will have a perfect shadow for women in distemper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The powder of orberé grain is darker than
<lb />umber & when you lack umber, the said powder will do,
<lb />but it does not have body.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Flesh color
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You must know well the mixing of colors & the appropriate
<lb />shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &
<lb />observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise,
<lb />as if going from <-l{ett}re a ga-> right to
<lb />left like
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />One cannot layer oil on cut paper & model as in
<lb />distemper because the color would run. Thus, to gild with
<lb />or mat, one needs to pounce & then layer the gold
<lb />color with the paintbrush.

<lb />Mirror
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
<lb />cristallin mirror, which represents
<lb />nature well, and in which <-it-> you will see if your
<lb />shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
<lb />candle, for firelight will make the shadows reddish.
<lb />The painter also teaches himself with the mirror,
<lb />for he sees in it what nature can do.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Fatty colors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
<lb />colors have penetrated, it means that this place is fatty, & that
<lb />the second colors one layers on would not take easily, unless
<lb />you rub this place with soap or breathe on it, because the
<lb />humidity will make the colors take.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />Every color or thing that becomes dense when water is put in during the
<lb />grinding has body. But those which do not have it, such as
<lb />pestled glass, lake, &c, become clear.

<lb />Semi-lively colors
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When colors <-a-> absorb into the canvas, it
<lb />means that it has been given imprimatura only once, & for this reason they
<lb />become matte rather than being shiny. But this is the best,
<lb />as long as you re-coat it twice, for in this manner, the colors, having
<lb />more body, do not die & are all the more beautiful for it,
<lb />especially azure, lake, & those do not have body. But
<lb />those who want to rush their painting apply imprimatura twice on the first go, to be
<lb />done with it. Thus the colors do not absorb, also they will not last as
<lb />long. The second layer of these does not absorb & remains
<lb />shiny.

<lb />From nature

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You need to put your charcoal at the tip of a stick
<lb />such that you make your first drawing from a distance because up close,
<lb />you would not be able to judge proportions as well as from a certain
<lb />& sufficient distance. Also, <-you-> when you paint up close, hold your
<lb />charcoal at the farthest end, & <-de-> practically with your
<lb />fingertips. For in this way you will acquire an

<lb />Glazing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One commonly glazes with colors that do not have body, such as
<lb />lake & verdigris. However, to use other colors, one
<lb />mixes in a quantity of calcined & ground cristallin, which also
<lb />has no body & <-makes-> lightens the density of the others.

<lb />One needs to be quite careful about this, & not make it, as some

<lb />Painting in distemper on wood
<lb />        
<lb />Because it is very tedious to paint in distemper on
<lb />wood, and because one is at pains to make a good
<lb /><-a-> face on it, some thin their colors with glair of egg
<lb />passed through a sponge, or mixed with the yolk,
<lb />water, & thoroughly beaten with the peelings of the fig
<lb />tree. With this 
<lb />| they paint & soften on the wood,
<lb />as with oil, and this supports the varnish, but this does
<lb />not last.
<lb />        
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The varnish will be dry in an hour. It
<lb />will increase the color of gold. And this or mat holds
<lb />in the rain, even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
<lb />for eight or ten days.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Gold color that is
<lb />made of different
<lb />colors cleaned
<lb />from paintbrushes for
<lb />oil is not so good, & with time,
<lb />tarnishes the gold because of the verdigris. One
<lb />must not touch with a finger the layer made for
<lb />the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The or
<lb />moulu is spoiled
<lb />if water touches it, but the or
<lb />mat holds well in the rain & in water.
<lb />One must not burnish it, because the tooth would remove it.
<lb />Gather the protrusions & small
<lb />flakes that the cotton makes lift off when the gold is
<lb />dry & you clean it, for an ounce is still gold. In
<lb />Flanders,
<lb />women <-make-> gild.
<lb />It is more beautiful when it is
<lb />a little thick, but in France
<lb />they beat it too delicately.

<lb />Colors in oil that are imbibed
<lb />        
<lb />It is best that colors in oil are imbibed, that is to say
<lb />they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
<lb />in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
<lb />oil has remained in that part, which would make the colors die.
<lb />The varnish mends all this & unites & renders it similar
<lb />in one place as in another. | It is necessary that gold color be laid down thick, for if it were clear, it
<lb />would be imbibed & would run.

<lb />The Flemish give a layer of distemper glue

<lb />Next they pounce some moresque in the corners & paint it
<lb />with minium, massicot, & ocre de ru,
<lb />and a little yellow ocher, tempered with fatty oil
<lb />in which they clean their paintbrushes for oil,
<lb />because the three aforesaid colors are gripping & dry immediately.
<lb />Next they lay down the gold, then varnish on top of all. And it
<lb />seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
<lb />oil, but it would not be good because the gold would
<lb />attach itself everywhere & not only to the moresque. Go

<lb />One ought not to gild with or mat after <-with->

<lb />it such that the hair comes together & is rendered
<lb />the same length. Put one or two bristles of a rat’s

<lb />petit-gris is <-at the->
<lb />whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind

<lb />Oil

<lb />lavender, but another fragrant one that resembles
<lb />olive oil. Every work done with glair
<lb />supports oil. It is with this that painters trick the

<lb />by locksmiths for their rough work are only made of
<lb />soft iron, but the soft files must be made of
<lb />steel. Founders whose work is to repair latten
<lb />& copper must have their files <-d->
<lb />coarse otherwise they would fill up with the copper which would
<lb />make them smooth & soon render them useless. Latten, which is

<lb />Bones of the foot of oxen for sand

<ab>
<lb />Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very

<lb />Essential oils
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Walnut oil mixed with as much of
<lb />turpentine & distilled through an alembic renders an
<lb />essence whiter than common water. But this has no body & does
<lb />not give bond to colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves
<lb />the color without hold and fading. These, imbibing in this way,
<lb />would not give you leisure to work and soften any more than in distemper. But
<lb />you mend this defect by giving it a little body with
<lb />turpentine, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can
<lb />work with azur d’esmail & will make a perfect
<lb />lead white. Turpentine varnish made with this oil
<lb />is dry in one hour.

<ab>
<lb />Casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I have tried four kinds of sand for lead & tin:
<lb />chalk, pestled glass, tripoli & burnt
<lb />linen, all 4 excellent. But as for the chalk, it needs to
<lb />be of the softest kind you can find, like the Champagne one
<lb />that painters use. It releases very neatly, does not want
<lb />to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs to be
<lb />completely dry, in its natural state, finely
<lb />pulverized. The first cast is always the
<lb />neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
<lb />the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
<lb />your frame mold to take new powdered chalk that has not
<lb />yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the frame has
<lb />dried out & does not have as much hold & bond like the fresh one.
<lb />Pestled glass can be made from common glass sand, however,
<lb />cristallin is more excellent, for common glass contains
<lb /><-glass-> salt of saltwort only, but
<lb />cristallin contains both salt of tartar &
<lb />saltwort all together, which both help fusion, the glass
<lb />once calcined & reduced as if to its prime substance. In order to
<lb />calcine it perfectly, throw your pieces of glass, whichever it be,
<lb />among the largest possible lit charcoals that you can, if you are
<lb />    lacking another amenity <-t->for violent fire<-t->.
<lb />And when it is well red, throw it into
<lb />water
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Putty is considered excellent for these two metals.

<lb />and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your
<lb />fingers and easily pestle in a mortar of metal, 
<lb />or better yet, of iron. Next, it
<lb />will be easy to grind it, not <-only-> on common
<lb />marble that would corrode, but on
<lb />porphyry, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
<lb />with water so that when putting it on your
<lb />fingernail, you find it soft without any asperity, like
<lb />the <-p-> colors that the painters grind for oil. This one, once dry, you can
<lb />use <-au lie-> instead of sand, in a frame 
<lb />without moistening it with anything nor reheating it, if you do
<lb />not want to; fumigate the hollow form with sulfur smoke or
<lb /><-of p-> with the tip of the flame of a wax candle
<lb />that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny &
<lb />polished work, in pure lead & tin. I would
<lb />say the same for finely pulverized tripoli that does not want to
<lb />be <-not-> reheated or moistened. Burnt linen gives less
<lb />trouble than any other, because it needs neither to be reheated nor to be
<lb />moistened, & molds and releases very neatly <-&
<lb />very->, subtly & <-releases well-> neatly, like the
<lb />previous ones do as well, & withstands several fusions. First one ought to burn
<lb />it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its
<lb />fire until it wears it out, then finely grind it on
<lb />marble or on a paper. <-But because a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />lot-> And if you reheat it in a crucible, red hot due to
<lb />the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will
<lb />be even better. But because a lot of linen is reduced to very
<lb />little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
<lb />medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the frame with pestled slate, which molds also very neatly. But
<lb />note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest.
<lb />If you cast opportunely, soft tin that seems to be
<lb />burnished in little wheels that pewterers sell, comes out
<lb />very neatly & approaching the color of silver, without mixing
<lb />in anything. It is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &
<lb />so that the molded object should be 4 fingers away
<lb />from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well,
<lb /><-with such a degree of heat-> so hot that it
<lb />promptly burns in a shiver a paper or straw placed
<lb />inside. Then remove it from the fire & leave it to
<lb />rest a little & cast. Tin mixed

<lb />with half lead comes out almost better than pure tin

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way so lean
<lb />& arid that it does not have bond, like the one from the
<lb />sea or <-desei-> from sandy
<lb />paths dried out by the sun. But choose
<lb />them <-or in t-> in the first place from
<lb />quar<-reries->ries or rock caves,
<lb />because that one is best, provided that it is very fine. You will recognize the
<lb />vein of it if, among the greyish rocks or quarries
<lb /><-qu-> that seem to be made of arene,
<lb />you see, after rainy weather, certain small
<lb />patches like dust attached to the said rocks, or if due to the
<lb />humidity, a small piece of it flakes off, which easily crushes between your 
<lb />hands. You will also find in lean soils some which comes
<lb />off in <-lop-> large lumps like stones of
<lb />tuf <-and not->, or among terres
<lb />bolvenes, which are much better than those in
<lb />fatty & strong earths. And one ought not to take it from the
<lb />surface, for fear that it be mixed with common earth, but three
<lb />or 4 feet below & the closest to the
<lb />tuf or stone. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say that it starts to take shape as a stone. But when it is wet, it
<lb />comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is quite granular, & that when crushed between the
<lb />fingers, it renders itself into very great subtlety, <-like 
<lb />impalpable->, keeping nevertheless its sandy asperity, without muddying the
<lb />fingers like clay. It is dried slightly on the

<lb />to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been hardly
<lb />put to work. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is
<lb />lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
<lb />thickness, it is necessary that your substance of copper be very
<lb />hot so that it penetrates & runs. Some mix lead in this
<lb />melt, but it is for large works & not for small ones.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand from oxen feet, burned twice & finely ground,
<lb />melts more neatly with copper than sand that I have seen,
<lb />& without crust. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
<lb /><-f-> with a thickness as delicate as a knife
<lb />blade or a card. And it was hollow on one side, opposite the
<lb />relief, which was on other side.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that lean sands be more moistened than
<lb />others, namely with magistra or good pure wine or
<lb />boiled wine with elm tree roots & similar things.
<lb />But very fine sands, like burned linen, which is fatty &
<lb />soft on its own, want to be applied dry.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All moistened sand wants to be strongly beaten & stirred, to
<lb />be ground finely & to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
<lb />when it is bathed.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The olive oil that some mix in with beaten egg
<lb />glair makes it become porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand of calcined glass withstands several fusions, but there
<lb />is nothing like the first ones. It also becomes porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Latten comes out well on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
<lb />good to mix it with a little copper, like a quarter
<lb />part, with the substance of skillets.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Founders do cast frames up to 30 or 40 lb,
<lb />but not more.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
<lb />releasing <-It-> because it crumbles. It is good that
<lb />it be alloyed with some fatty thing which has bond such as molded
<lb />tripoli or <-ab-> burned felt or sal
<lb />ammoniac or tripoli & similar things.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f138" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the fumes of
<lb />the substance you are melting, because the cast is imprinted with the quality
<lb /><-e->of the metal, which afterward runs more easily in something that comes from it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Human bones are the best for casting once
<lb />calcined.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot
<lb />& to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some
<lb />iron scales, either in powder or otherwise, <-E-> for
<lb />it heats copper a lot & cleanses it of its grease. At the
<lb />end, when you want to cast, add some saltpeter, by folding your
<lb />additions in a paper in order that everyone may not know what you
<lb />mix in.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sheep foot bones are even better than those of oxen
<lb />foot.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Oil & tallow make it very porous, &
<lb />    pestled glass, & copper alone.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cendrée earth molds very neatly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Ash does not have enough body to withstand
<lb />copper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is better not to mix the sands, but to fill the frame with
<lb />one only.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Latten is always fatty, & does not mold neatly. One finds
<lb />that it comes out better alloyed with a quarter of
<lb />copper, but let it be cast very hot.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    Copper comes out well with a bit of metal. If you mix
<lb />in metal within latten, it will be more brittle & more
<lb />troublesome.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Slightly coarser sand has more body.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand from <-corp-> rock is always better,
<lb />which seems like tuf in lumps, which has a beautiful
<lb />& very fine grain, & a little fatty. One pestles it, then one
<lb />dries it in a skillet on the fire, until it <-is-> no longer
<lb />smokes, then one passes it through a fine & double sieve,
<lb />& one molds with it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Copper or latten cannot come out well if the medal does
<lb />not sufficient thickness, & if it does not have it, give it some
<lb />with wax.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some cast through a hole made in the middle of the reverse side of the
<lb />medal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some, wanting to cast large works in latten, <-in it->
<lb />mix in the sand some pestled glass to give the earth
<lb />bond. But it makes it porous, and the work needs to be repaired.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One puts in lead for a large work to make it run, but not
<lb /><-not
<lb />for-> in a small one because it would leave filth all around
<lb />the work.

<ab>
<lb />

<ab>
<lb />Copper <-is meil-> and latten are proper to
<lb />cast & at the right heat when they throw off, while stirring them in the
<lb />crucible, a very white flame & that the bath is very
<lb />liquid.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some cast in well ground ceruse <-for
<lb />the->, others in flour moistened several times with
<lb />oil <-& g-> & dried in the
<lb />sun.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Others, for casting in lead, old
<lb />printers' type or the composition thereof.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Others put into the tin or lead a substance of
<lb />fixed quicksilver which makes it run.

<lb />Wood with streaked grain
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The elm, in its knotty root, has beautiful streaks
<lb />diversified with grey and black, and the root of the
<lb />maple, but one needs to choose well the grain of the
<lb />wood. One gives the maple a certain yellow color,
<lb />then one varnishes it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mulled and sugared wine
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The English, when they feel a cold coming on, mull wine in this
<lb />manner. They heat it in a <-large-> tin pot until
<lb />it boils, and when it is boiling up, they <-remove it from->
<lb />light it with burning paper to know if it is hot
<lb />enough. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
<lb />vessel into another, as one who wants to beat eau
<lb />panée, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
<lb />burning paper what is falling from one vessel into the
<lb />other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
<lb />wine is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
<lb />cloves & a sufficient quantity of sugar. And
<lb />they <-boi-> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The common English put sugar in wine to affect
<lb />for themselves the sweet new wine, which they cannot have because,
<lb />owing to the long sea crossing, the wine has lost its
<lb />sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Weary horses
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For fortifying a harried horse, they make it drink some of
<lb />the aforesaid wine through a horn, and it finds itself
<lb />disposed for doing an even greater labor.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Eau-de-vie
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The Irish do not drink any wine because they convert
<lb />it into eau-de-vie, which they use almost as habitually as we use

<lb />Varnish
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To a half lb of spike lavender oil, put in
<lb />4 ℥ of sandarac & mastic subtly pulverized. 
<lb />And first, boil your oil in a
<lb />pot on a chafing dish, and then mix in little by
<lb />little the aforesaid gums, stirring continually with a
<lb />small stick split and quartered at the tip, & when you do
<lb />not collect gum with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
<lb />melted & that your varnish is done. And to render it clearer,
<lb />put in a small lump of camphor to decoct. It is true that
<lb />with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the spike
<lb />lavender oil be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise
<lb />your varnish would be worth nothing. You can test it,
<lb /><-d-> soaking some paper in it & heating
<lb />it. If the oil, which will evaporate, leaves the paper
<lb />clean, without <-being-> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
<lb />fatty.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sheep fat
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In a certain region of England, the sheep that
<lb />graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as
<lb />others.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spider
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In Ireland, there are none, & if one touches them
<lb />with wood that is there, they die. This is why some
<lb />rich people of England make their ceilings from this
<lb />wood, & by this method, they never have cobwebs
<lb />& spiderwebs.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Grindings are very good for casting in
<lb />copper, but one ought not to take those of
<lb />cutlers, because it is only sludge, but rather those
<lb />of those who <-mold-> grind large shears.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Pierres de filieres, with which
<lb />those who sharpen smooth, mold very neatly, once scraped, for lead. It is
<lb />commonly slate-colored. One frequently brings them to
<lb />Toulouse from around Carcassonne.

<lb />Printer’s letters
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Those who make them, mix into the lead some
<lb /><-nails-> nailheads & old
<lb />horseshoes, & antimony which makes it all melt.
<lb />This composition is strong for printing, & holds up. It runs
<lb />and is good for casting in lead.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Casting in copper 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that the frame be quite even & that
<lb />it fits well also on the board where it is set, so that it holds
<lb />firm & does not shift when one molds. It is necessary that the sand
<lb />be clean & well chosen and well reheated, & pulverized very
<lb />finely on marble, for the one that you want to put
<lb />first on the medal, and that you press strongly when molding. Guard against
<lb />oiling your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
<lb />and reheat well, & let cool. Moisten your sand with wine boiled
<lb />with elm root, and cast latten which comes out well /
<lb />namely from the substance of the trebuschets and similar
<lb />thin things. Make your gate broad & even if it is barely thick, it
<lb />will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the mold. Cast
<lb />from the foot of the medal, in order that the face, further away from the
<lb />heat, comes out better & more relieved from the violent heat. And if
<lb />your frame does not have vents, make some
<lb /><-qu-> in the sand, which come from the edges 
<lb />of the piece, to go into the gate. Cast very hot, which you
<lb />will recognize when you throw a little reserved substance in that
<lb />which is already well melted, & if it melts quickly, this is a sign
<lb />it is <-fo-> quite hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
<lb />of your furnace with bellows of the right size,
<lb />keeping the mouth of the furnace well covered with some large
<lb /><-cuivr-> tile or other similar thing,
<lb />which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
<lb />your red-hot pincers & the crooked
<lb />iron as well, to clean the charcoals which are in
<lb />your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a latten
<lb />wirebrush. The grindings from sharpening large scissors &
<lb />large knives is very good for copper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One believes it to be a great secret to put in
<lb />persicaire, which renders them soft as lead. Try
<lb />to extract salts from it.
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f143" />
<ab>

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead, which is mortified & weighty, wants to be cast hot,
<lb />more so than tin. And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines
<lb />in the medal. <-It-> Straw burns in it, however little
<lb />hot it is. One can make a solder so soft & runny that it can be
<lb />melted in a tin dish. It is composed of one
<lb />part looking-glass tin, one part soft
<lb />tin, & another part lead. It runs very neatly
<lb />and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle & breakable. The best solder is the common one for casting well, but
<lb /><-is-> leaves certain points lumpy. Alloy lead with
<lb />tin so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even &
<lb />shiny & polished, & without any eyes or bubbles except for a
<lb />small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is
<lb />enough tin, otherwise the lead dominates too much. Sand is
<lb />good for lead & tin. The good one is very thin &
<lb />fine & lean, which nonetheless sticks together between one’s
<lb />fingers. The sand wants to be reheated before putting
<lb />it to use. And <-once-> to mold with it, it wants to
<lb />be much moistened & then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst
<lb />of fire, for this corrupts & makes it shrink & crumble as well.
<lb />But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well
<lb />moistened. One ought to pass it through a shirt
<lb />sleeve for the finest one, in order to put it first on
<lb />the piece to mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One makes a solder with quicksilver,
<lb /><-But-> which is white, but it is brittle. Make it so that your frame 
<lb />joins well & that one does not see the light between the joints.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The Germans cast their leads very thinly, because it seems 
<lb />they come out better than very thick ones, but in order that
<lb />are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little tin with the
<lb />said lead, which otherwise would bend like wax.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The blackest lead, so some say, is the best & the softest
<lb />& which runs the best. You will know its goodness by rubbing it
<lb />with your finger, which will render it very black
<lb />immediately.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The alloy good for running lead & tin is per one
<lb />lb of lead, one lb & a half of tin,
<lb /><-Aultr-> in order that the tin exceeds more than one
<lb />part. It is solder which flows well & is good
<lb />for casting, but it is brittle.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To make the lead flow well, one puts in a little
<lb />quicksilver.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Rub cuttlefish bone on a well evened table to
<lb />flatten it & one against the other & pierce through the two bones
<lb />with pegs to mark the place.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cuttlefish bone molds lead better than
<lb />anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. <-One ought
<lb />to mold on the back of the bones & from this side for the
<lb />marrow is more delicate there.->
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The bone marrow toward the tail is more delicate & does have
<lb />not as many stripes & molds more cleanly. The shell which
<lb />holds the marrow, once calcined, is good for making sand.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you cast lead, you need to cast it <-cast very
<lb />neatly-> rather hot, & not at once & shake the
<lb />frame a little & cast two or three times. However, if it
<lb />is cast too hot, it will rise up & swell. When it is very hot, it
<lb />becomes blue, let it then pass this color <-deva-> &
<lb />rest a little before casting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some, such as printers, mix iron or pin filings 
<lb />in the lead, <-But-> in order to render it
<lb />hard. But this renders it brittle & <-not-> it breaks under
<lb />the hammer.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a wirebrush to clean your molds.

<ab>
<lb />For making gray wood
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to take three half-septiers of iron
<lb />filings, xviii <-s-> deniers'-worth of
<lb />glass alum, & as much green copperas,
<lb />six deniers'-worth of verdigris, <-am-> pitch,
<lb />& a quart of <-cuyr-> currier's
<lb />water, and if you cannot find it, you will put <-more->
<lb />rainwater  of small degree. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For gilding on wood
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First one needs to put down a layer of very clear glue, and
<lb />once dry, you will put down a layer of yellow gold. And when it is
<lb />done, you will take fig tree wood, & put it to soak
<lb />some space of time, & wash the places you want to gild, and
<lb />cut your gold with a knife to the price that you will
<lb />lay. And one must lay the said gold with 
<lb />cotton <-ie->. 
<lb />And if you can find a fig tree,
<lb />take the the white of one egg & stir it vigorously.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your gold does not have beautiful enough color, you will take
<lb />a partridge feather, & make it burn in a
<lb />chafing-dish, and make the smoke go against what you have
<lb />gilded.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For gilding with or moleu
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to take a shell of gold
<lb />and, before you want to work with it, you will put it to soak with gum
<lb />water and lay it down with a paintbrush, &
<lb />polish it with a wolf’s <-skin-> tooth when it
<lb />is dry.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Recipe for putting all woods in color
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making it black, one needs to soak it in olive
<lb />oil, and similarly for horn, as the case may be, four or five
<lb />days, & then boil it where it has soaked
<lb />for the space of one hour, & take it out of the
<lb />oil, and take some natural sulfur or another
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f150" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />if you cannot find it, and cover the said wood with this
<lb />powder, until it is cool, & you will make it boil again, &
<lb />boiling it, one will see if it is black enough or not. If it is not
<lb />enough, you take the said powder & put it on the said wood
<lb />while boiling.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making wood green
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to take one quart of white vinegar & one
<lb />ounce of green & one ounce of glass alum, all mixed together, and you will put your substances
<lb />into a leaded pot over the fire without taking air,
<lb />& then put the pot in a dung heap for
<lb />fifteen days, and once it is out, you will boil your
<lb />substances for the space of three hours.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making wood red
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take one quart of old urine and three ounces of
<lb />madder & one ounce of glass alum, and you will put all in your pot, & do
<lb />as with green.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making it blue
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take one quart of urine as above and one ounce
<lb />of alum & two drams of sal ammoniac &
<lb />half an ounce of pastel woad flowers, the whole made
<lb />into powder, and do as with green.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making it violet 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take one quart of urine & one ounce of

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First take very yellow orange peel, & clean them
<lb />well of the white that is inside, & pulverize them very well
<lb /><-and-> in a very clean mortar. And take as
<lb />much of sulfur, & grind all together, and put everything in
<lb />a glass vial, & keep them in the cellar or
<lb />other humid place for the space of eight or ten
<lb />days. Then when you want to use it, one needs to

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For gilding on iron or tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First one needs to wash that which one wants to gild in wine
<lb />lees, and then wash it again with white wine, and take three
<lb />ounces terra merita & a chopin of
<lb />white wine, and boil the substances the space of half an
<lb />hour, & put down your colors on your iron or
<lb />tin, or other, and then let it dry on a piece of

<lb />Recipe for making bronze and varnish of many
<lb />sorts
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making excellent varnish with clear water which
<lb />you will use with a paintbrush and immediately dry, for
<lb />putting on paper, a tablet, or another piece.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />First, you will take five ounces of eau-de-vie
<lb />and one ounce of benzoin pestled between
<lb />two pieces of paper or card or in a mortar,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f153" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />but it should not be too small, then take <-[illegible]-> a
<lb />glass vial not too big and put into it a half of these
<lb />two, namely two & a half ounces. Next take the said
<lb />benzoin just as coarsely pestled, and put it to use with the
<lb />said water and let it rest for the space of one & half
<lb />days, & then take the said water &
<lb />put it into another glass vial & mix it very well.
<lb />And on the rest of the said benzoin that remains at the bottom of
<lb />the said first vial, put the rest of the water over this,
<lb />and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the
<lb />first water with the second. By means of this you will be able to
<lb />use it for something more noble.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Another approved varnish
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take two ounces of linseed oil & two
<lb />ounces of petrolle oil and two
<lb />ounces of mastic, the whitest you can find, and of
<lb />glass alum, & grind it, and take a little bit of
<lb />white copperas, and put all these drugs together into an

<lb />when it will be melted, you will pass it in a clean cloth
<lb />& you will see a beautiful varnish.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Another varnish

<lb />Ra<-ie->c
<lb />& grind it coarsely, and then put it into the spike
<lb />lavender oil, & then mix it with a stick until you
<lb />see that it is melted, and then put it in a glass vial.
<lb />And when you want to use it, heat it little by little over the
<lb />charcoals. And before putting it down, put down a coat of very
<lb />clear glue, & then put it down with a paintbrush.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making red varnish
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take vermilion & temper it with gum water as well

<lb />then lay it down as before <-for making three green->.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making <-tr->wood green
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take very strong vinegar, salt, &
<lb />rainwater, and one needs to put it all together with
<lb />verdigris, and put it in a new earthen vessel
<lb />with your wood, & put it in some very warm horse
<lb />dung for the space of eight or nine days.

<ab>
<lb />For making bronze in the color of gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take copper filings & ocher & gum &

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making wood gray

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For making water for disease of the eyes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take white copperas, & heat it a little on the fire, then put
<lb />it as a powder on a white cloth stretched over a very clean
<lb />glass, & the powder on top, then take
<lb />fountain water & pass it through the said
<lb />cloth, while stirring the said powder with the

<ab>
<lb />Tin for casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They use common tin, which is the one that

<lb /><-ten-> ten lb of fine lead for one
<lb />quintal of tin.

<ab>
<lb />If you wish to make water rise higher than its source, make a
<lb />pipe descend as in A to B. in order to give it push
<lb /><-to the water->, then from B to C make the
<lb />pipe ascend again, which should not quite attain the height of
<lb />the source, which is represented to you by this horizontal line, then
<lb />make the pipe descend again from C to D, then raise it again,
<lb />higher than the line showing the height of the source. And do this
<lb />successively until you have reached the desired height, heeding
<lb />nonetheless that the length of the descending pipe should be
<lb />twice as long as the ascending pipe. This
<lb />cornet folded back on itself also shows you a perpetual
<lb />fountain which you can fit into some rock, pulling the water with
<lb />which it is filled by the tip marked E, by sucking &
<lb />breathing in. You can also make a watering pipe in this manner, such
<lb />that the trussed-up length is as long as its straight pipe,
<lb />& nevertheless does not descend as far down.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They usually cast with solder, even the things that should
<lb />not come out empty, for the latter require fine & soft tin,
<lb />which however would not release, & would not come out empty if it
<lb />was mixed or had some looking-glass tin <-mix->
<lb />in it, just like they put in a little of it in soft
<lb />tin. They engrave their works on stones of which are made the
<lb />sharpening stones or files of barbers, which are found in
<lb />great flakes near the mountains, & resemble
<lb />slate. They are of three colors: reddish, which is not as
<lb />perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire
<lb /><-& as->, one <-dard-> of the color of dark
<lb />slate, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they
<lb />imprint it on carton as thick as one
<lb />finger, to serve as a pattern, then with a
<lb />little compass & little matching iron fittings, they
<lb />engrave their figures, having first flattened their stones &
<lb />worn down one against the other, they make their <-p->
<lb />molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
<lb />perfectly, because the stones render themselves even. Before
<lb />casting, they rub the mold with tallow, which has quickly
<lb />absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking fine powder of
<lb />quicklime in a linen, they pounce the mold while
<lb />beating with the linen on top, then blow a little on top
<lb />to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
<lb />the work is largish. They make them in this manner, as you see
<lb />represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
<lb />least visible. And then with a borer they pierce the mold on
<lb />the side of the medal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
<lb />a bit of cork at this place in the mold. And
<lb />the lead or tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> will not attach to it. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Try to engrave with distilled vinegar.

<lb />Try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be

<lb />Sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One can find an excellent one on the little hill of
<lb />Puy David near Thoulouse
<lb />for lead, tin & copper. It does not want to be
<lb />too much reheated because, drying out all at once, it loses its
<lb />bond & burns at the first arrival of metal, which makes
<lb />the work lumpy & not neat. It is better to reheat from a distance,
<lb />rather than with a straw flame, which generates
<lb /><-some-> some filth. Before filling in the frame, you can put in the finest sand you have in a very fine
<lb />linen, & dry pounce the medal and then the moistened sand
<lb />that you put on top, which has more body, will grip it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tallow makes it porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Fixed mercury mixed in when one wants to cast, makes
<lb /><-metal-> lead run. But if it is pure, one ought to cast
<lb />very hot so that it runs. And vents.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Earth for molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tanner’s earth, or the one with which
<lb />potters make a whitening on pots to make lead run
<lb />better on them & to prevent the lead from being absorbed into
<lb />them, is very good for molding the hollow forms of things you want make in
<lb />relief. It releases better than plaster or sulfur which
<lb />become hard once they have set. For the earth being ready, one
<lb />ought to beat it hard so that it does not crack. If the piece is very
<lb />large you can mold it in several parts. If you reheat it, it is
<lb />necessary that it be over a closed fire. One finds this earth at
<lb />Fosseret & in another place
<lb />called Ox.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that it be well cooked, which you will recognize
<lb />when cooking it in an iron or metal pot, you
<lb />mix it with an iron rod, & if it attaches to the
<lb />iron, it is not cooked enough, if not, it is good. The
<lb />water with which you temper it should be a little warm & the
<lb />mold made with the aforesaid earth also a little hot.
<lb />The work of plaster does not last & the faces & delicate
<lb />things break if one does not give a coat of glue.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Carton
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought to take paper from Florence, which is the
<lb />finest, & pestle it & soak it several times & change the
<lb />water every day, so that it does not smell bad, &
<lb />when you have molded it in the hollow form, put a
<lb />linen over it, & from the back, rub it with a tooth, as if you wanted to burnish it, and
<lb />it will mold very neatly. Then glue the cloth on the back with strong glue.

<lb />Sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Only brick, very finely sifted, & worn down one against
<lb />another, is good for all castings of lead and copper,
<lb />mixed with urine. This needs to be of that whitish
<lb />brick.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Making copper and latten run
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Put in at the end, when it is very hot & when you want to cast,
<lb />sal ammoniac & saltpeter, which removes filth
<lb />& heats it. Mix some ardides with the latten.
<lb /> Guard against the metal touching the iron or the
<lb />latten of the frame, but cover it with sand or
<lb />lute. Do the casting very evenly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand

<ab>
<lb />Calcined black pebbles from the river are good for
<lb />lead, but they dullen metal.

<lb />Latten runs better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Frame casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is good to make it with boxwood. Turn it in order
<lb />to make it even, as this is important for the casting. Lute also,
<lb />or cover the mouth of the frame with sand in order that the melted
<lb />metal, or lead, or copper does not touch the
<lb />frame’s iron or latten, because it makes it
<lb />brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
<lb />higher than the mold. Also guard against the cast being too
<lb />wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
<lb />the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the
<lb />mold & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
<lb />frame, in order that the substance spreads better. Black lead of
<lb />saulmon from the first melting makes a very neat one.

<lb />mark a line on the cogwheel with a sharp point, then move the alidade

<lb />Latten of potin <-cor->, which is
<lb />the most brittle, molds more neatly, according to the opinion of many
<lb />people, than fine latten of pots, just like all fine
<lb />latten molds neater than red copper. If you want to cast
<lb />something fine & thin, the entire secret is to cast as hot as
<lb />possible so that the substance boils. You will recognize that it is hot
<lb />enough when it smokes a lot and while stirring it throws sparks. To heat
<lb />well, place your crucible as low as possible & at the very
<lb />bottom of the forge, so that the bellows
<lb /><-fra-> beat on the middle of the crucible, for
<lb />in this way it is better than on the grate on which one usually
<lb />puts the crucible, under which the bellows beat. It is
<lb />true that the crucible risks more danger breaking, but you can
<lb />lute it as you know founders do. And also, one ought
<lb />to maintain the charcoal between the bellows & the
<lb />crucible. Also take heed to cast all at once & not in
<lb />increments & drop by drop, which would stop & plug up the
<lb />conduit of the substance. And if you were to make in the cast a
<lb />trough to feed the medal, it would be even better. And in order
<lb />that the substance heats well at the bottom, stir it, once melted, with

<lb />A way for molding excellently with water
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Dissolve in humid place some sandiver, and then
<lb />place this water on what you want to mold, having encircled it,
<lb />and place it to coagulate on the hot ashes. Do the same with
<lb />vitriol & copperas, which, once well calcined, reduce
<lb />in water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary to cast two pieces of copper, latten or
<lb />similar metal, very neatly, and then when you have molded the
<lb />hollow form in the sand, leave the figure of metal that you
<lb />[<-s->] have molded in the frame, without moving it
<lb />from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a
<lb />little & push the figure down in the frame.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but
<lb />with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at
<lb />the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the
<lb />filth & grime accumulate. And, in this way, if you
<lb />were mold the face toward the cast, some grime could be found
<lb />there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier
<lb />to repair.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Vinegar is better for moistening than wine. It is
<lb />necessary that the frame be quite smooth and even otherwise,
<lb /><-And that the cast be-> as you press on one side, the other one
<lb />lifts.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This is why the press is better, for it tightens evenly, &
<lb />more than your hands, and makes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />the coarse sand, which is humid, communicate its humidity to the
<lb />soft & fine sand, which is sprinkled & pounced dry
<lb />on the medal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you mold, always leave your medal in <-the one->
<lb />some frames, <-Is-> without stirring
<lb />it because, if your hollow form is not molded very neatly, you can put
<lb />it back in the right place by means of pegs, which will prevent
<lb />it from shifting. But, at first, pounce your medal with very
<lb />fine willow charcoal, & <-se-> next
<lb />clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release afterward.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the

<ab>
<lb />Bellows
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To melt with bellows, & hasten your melt,
<lb />& also cast hotter <-po->, do not place your
<lb />bellows at the bottom near the foot of the furnace,
<lb />for fear that some charcoal might <-you-> enter it, put
<lb />them almost under the grate. It is good that your
<lb />four à vent be in an aerated place so that the
<lb />wind might make it heat better, & that it be well dry,
<lb />& reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the furnace
<lb />& that there is only the entry of the blast-pipe of the
<lb />bellows. And by the end, you need to give it force,

<lb />a knife. I oiled my medal, because oil cleans it
<lb />without spoiling it. <-And-> And having dried it & cleaned it
<lb />with a linen cloth & very small hog bristle 
<lb />brushes, I once again lightly anointed it with clear
<lb />walnut oil & gently passed a linen cloth
<lb />over it so that it does not remain too anointed, and I noted that,
<lb />by this means, it would come out better in release, because the
<lb />ceruse, once moistened with water of glair of egg, would not
<lb />attach to the oil. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
<lb />high relief very neatly, without any sticking, which a lot of
<lb />good sands, such as felt, burnt bone & iron
<lb />dross, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my
<lb />mold became hard like marble, and by this I knew
<lb />that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
<lb />water, which gives them body & compactness, such as glair, 
<lb />gummed water, <-ea-> wine boiled

<lb />that the material was whitish, almost like metalline, but this was because

<lb />Since then I have molded the bone of oxen feet, burned,

<lb />on it moderately while molding. Having <-undone the-> opened the

<lb />left the molds floury & crumbling. I
<lb /><-them-> moistened the bone sand further, so that
<lb />it gave a good hold <-in the-> between the
<lb />fingers, and in this way, I molded neatly with a good
<lb />release. And even though it seemed to me that the pulverized bone
<lb />was coarse, if there is some material of a skillet thrown in, my
<lb />figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated
<lb />my frame; it withstood only one cast. I find that
<lb />when a sand is so finely ground that it renders itself dense as
<lb />ceruse & even, <-like-> without knowing it to be arid,
<lb />rarefied, sandy & rather spongy, that it molds
<lb />very neatly, but it does not receive metal so well as if it were
<lb />porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fatty & even, it
<lb />becomes porous & does not receive fine features. I believe that
<lb />the secret to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the
<lb />metal well, one for lead, the other for another, for each
<lb />one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly & carefully, and
<lb />leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the
<lb />time for this. And next, reheat it very well, not all at once nor 
<lb />with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles &
<lb />always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast copper or
<lb />latten or other great metals very hot &, if it is
<lb />possible, in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than
<lb />small quantities. It is necessary that the frame be cold, &
<lb />that you cast all at once. Always lute the entrance of your

<lb />at once & out of the wind. And if your medal is really
<lb />thin, put a card or two or three thicknesses of
<lb />paper underneath, when you want to mold it. In

<lb />crust, and my sand was not corrupted at all. Since then, I
<lb />have cast with it several casts of soft lead & tin
<lb />that came out better & more neatly than any other that I have ever
<lb />found.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you mold, make certain lines around your mold, in the
<lb />frame, in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this
<lb />way.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Potin of syringe & other
<lb /><-co-> works runs even better than fine latten.
<lb />But I think that it is better half copper &
<lb />half latten, which have been used & have been in
<lb />very thin works, such as skillets & other similar things. I have
<lb />seen this mixture of half come out well.

<pb facs="#f172" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To mold well, one ought to cast in a big frame several
<lb />medals together, for when there is a lot of substance & the
<lb />crucible is almost full, it heats more, & then, if one
<lb />medal does not come out well, the other will be good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is better to melt in a bellows furnace than in a
<lb />four à vent, because it gives a more vigorous heat. It
<lb />is true that latten melts well in the four à
<lb />vent, because it is easier to melt than copper, being
<lb />more brittle.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some founders have this superstition,
<lb />that only three days a week are good for melting, namely
<lb />Tuesdays, <-Wednesdays->
<lb />Thursdays, and Saturdays. The others, for them,
<lb />are unlucky.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you mold, do not knock excessively on the medal, which is in
<lb />the sand, because it prevents it from releasing very neatly &
<lb />shakes loose the mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take heed also that the sand does not surpass the edges of the
<lb />frame, for it makes the molded medal higher than the cast,
<lb />& in this way, metal will never enter the mold. Therefore,
<lb />always make sure that the surface of your cast object surpasses the mold in a straight line, and to do this, if it seems good to you, put a
<lb />piece of carton of whatever thickness you
<lb />please.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Founders, in order to prevent their large cast
<lb />works from becoming porous, are careful to reheat their molds very well. And
<lb />to know if they have been reheated sufficiently, they knock against it with
<lb />their finger, & if they start to ring like a pot,
<lb />then they are sufficiently reheated.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To cast their cannons neatly, they mix their earth
<lb />with some fine casting sand, if they can find any.

<lb />Sand from Thoulouse
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The usual <-bo-> good one is the one which is
<lb />found in a vineyard near Puy David, but the one
<lb />which is most excellent is the one from the Touch, near
<lb />Sainct Michel & toward Blagnac, in a
<lb />vineyard that is quite high up. The latter is finer
<lb />& a little fatter than the other, & better for small works. It
<lb />does not want to be reheated too much.

<lb />Sand, slate, and burned earth
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Thoroughly burnt sand loses its bond. Slate is reheated & molds
<lb />neatly. Next, it is true that it often becomes porous, as burned
<lb />earth also does, as fatty sand also does.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I find that one ought not to knock on very finely ground sands, for it
<lb />shakes them loose & <-makes-> prevents them from releasing
<lb />neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.

<lb />Sand from the mine of Thoulouse
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Casting sand coming from the mine, once passed through a
<lb />double sieve, next put in with melted resin, burns &
<lb />inflames & becomes all red & inflamed like iron. Once
<lb />cold, it is completely black and can be ground very finely on
<lb />porphyry. Having prepared it thus & rendered it
<lb />without asperity on the fingernail, I moistened it
<lb />with beaten glair of egg & beat it well, until it was not pasty
<lb />but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, & molded with
<lb />it in lead & tin very neatly, but it wants to be well
<lb />reheated & at ease.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Others beat it well in a mortar, in small amounts at a
<lb />time, & thus it is pressed together and rendered very fine. Then
<lb />they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Next, they grind it dry on
<lb />porphyry. And thus it becomes as if impalpable and not
<lb />too dried out, <-it-> and it retains the body & the bond of the
<lb />earth to which it is kin and is better than when it is so
<lb />burnt. Once moistened with glair of egg passed through a
<lb />sponge, it releases <-very neatly M-> very
<lb />neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore,
<lb />since then, I have experimented <-lexper-> with
<lb />moistening it only with very strong vinegar. It released a
<lb />figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,
<lb />moistening the finest in a fashion as with glair, & the
<lb />coarsest, for filling, with gushes of salt water or
<lb />wine, that they do not join so well. But as they are of one
<lb />nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other & hold
<lb />together one with the other.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For molding well, after having prepared your sands, mold in
<lb />a day. Slowly reheat them the next day, then cast them
<lb />on another.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought to choose the one which is <-as-> in clods
<lb />& lumps, well deep in the earth, for usually the one that
<lb />is found higher up is too much a kin of the earth, and the lower is a kin of the rock.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I have molded it from pure lead cast very <-neatly-> hot, & I had as an example the very neat principal, but the
<lb />vinegar hardly gives it any bond, & thus it sustained only
<lb />one cast.

<lb />The one and the other, once very finely ground on

<lb />reworked them together on porphyry & passed them
<lb />through a double sieve or through the sleeve of a

<lb />& put them on a marble in a cellar. In
<lb />one night, they had been wet enough by
<lb />themselves without moistening them further, because rock salt, like
<lb />all other salts, dissolves in the humidity. I molded very

<lb />Mineral sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it
<lb />must be in one piece & as if taken from a quarry or
<lb />rock formation, & the deeper one takes it from, the
<lb />better. The signs of its goodness are that it is thus amassed, and that
<lb />when removing itself in the form of rock, it comes out in lumps &
<lb /><-qu-> bricks, which demonstrate its bond & that it
<lb />is not too lean.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />However, it should break apart between your
<lb />hands & have very small
<lb /><-men-> & delicate grains & of the same nature.
<lb />If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either
<lb />through water or through a sieve <-& when
<lb />it-> or on the porphyry, & in this way, from
<lb /><-sil-> lean they become fatty & well bound. You
<lb />can mold with it in <-sa-> frame or
<lb />en noyau without cloth waste, & try it with
<lb />lead, for if with this it does not become porous & casts
<lb />neatly, it will also behave well with copper. Some say that the
<lb />fatty sands do not want the metal to be cast too hot.
<lb />Artisans who work in large works &, who for profit, do not
<lb />need to grind & seek the curiosities of artificial sands,
<lb />benefit more from seeking some that is ready-made by nature, which has the
<lb />finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it
<lb />through a sieve. But those who work in small works, finely
<lb />grind it & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of

<lb />Sand of burnt ox bones and rock salt

<lb />I have pulverized them separately & finely ground them on

<lb />of one as the other & reworked them on
<lb />porphyry. Next, I moistened it in paper,
<lb />folded in a wet napkin, which is previously made in the
<lb />serain of the night or in the
<lb />moisture of the cellar. And I have not found anything else
<lb />which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid.
<lb />And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out
<lb />very neatly in soft tin, like the principal, and withstood
<lb />several casts. For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to
<lb />seek a better one, nor for fine lead either, which comes out almost
<lb />as neatly as tin. <-Tou-> The bone of the foot
<lb />of oxen is always so lean on its own that, without being

<lb />Sal ammoniac and alabaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Sal ammoniac, well pulverized <-mou-> &
<lb />ground dry on marble, molds very neatly & is of a very beautiful release, & once mixed with alabaster, pulverized
<lb />similarly, ii ℥ per lb of
<lb />alabaster makes it release well. It suffices to moisten it in
<lb />a cave or in the serain or, to
<lb />be done more quickly, in a piece of paper between a wet
<lb />napkin. Take heed that it does not stay for too long, for it
<lb />would become so wet that it would not be good for molding
<lb />in a frame, but rather en noyau, in which you will be
<lb />able to use it well as long as it dries well at ease & far from the
<lb />fire. Otherwise the heat makes it swell & pushes the salt onto
<lb />the surface, which renders it lumpy. You can <-in-> anoint the
<lb />medal with spike lavender oil, molding 
<lb />en noyau. It is better to put in 4 ℥ of
<lb />sal ammoniac per lb, and moisten it in a humid
<lb />place for two or three days, & so that
<lb />when you take fistfuls, it holds together, without, however,
<lb />attaching itself & being pasted to your hand. You
<lb />will mold very neatly with it. But let it dry & reheat very thoroughly,
<lb />leaving the mold inside so that it acquires strength by
<lb />reheating, for it becomes hard as stone &, in this way, is
<lb />more certain to release well. Otherwise if you release before having
<lb />reheated it, there would be danger of it crumbling in some
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />place because of its delicateness & fineness, even if the medal has a high
<lb />relief. Once you have molded with it, pulverize it as before and put it
<lb />back in the humidity.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All sand that releases well has body & gives a good hold. Ammoniac
<lb />is fatty and <-a va-> is nevertheless sandy,
<lb />which makes it release well. There is no better bond than salts
<lb />appropriate for metals, for once mixed in powder, they get moistened
<lb />together & dry & reheat together.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Glassmakers’ white sand from the
<lb />mine, mixed with sal ammoniac
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />There is found in Cominge, near the town of
<lb />Aurignac, a sand white <-mai-> like
<lb />salt and lean, that glassmakers &
<lb />potters use, which becomes impalpable ground on
<lb />porphyry & is easy to grind. And once ground, it
<lb />resembles calcined alabaster. It molds very neatly, and I have
<lb />not found any that molds as delicately as this one for low<-f-> relief. It is
<lb />excellent to mold en noyau without a frame, having ground it
<lb />impalpable with gummed or pure water on porphyry,
<lb />then placing it, thick as mustard or a little more, on the medal,
<lb />anointed lightly with oil either of olive, walnut, or even
<lb />better spike lavender. But to do it better
<lb /><-mo->, let it dry by itself, without fire, for one or
<lb />two days. Although, if you are in a hurry, you can
<lb />heat it well, & it will not crack if it is not put on too lightly.
<lb />It is true, being thus suddenly exposed to heat all at once, it makes
<lb />some holes & pustules, which it does not do when dried in the cold or
<lb />at ease rather than being reheated. Once dry, reheat it & it will
<lb />withstand several casts.

<lb />Artisans who work in large works & who need to further
<lb />their profit by seeking things already prepared in nature, because she

<lb />use for grinding finely & for artificially preparing sands, seek
<lb />the one of the <-s-> mine<-s->,
<lb />which is not too fatty, the one that is a kin of earth, not too lean &
<lb />consequently without bond, but rather that which is pulled from the
<lb />depths of the sand-bed in bricks & clods that show
<lb />its natural compaction, which is quite difficult to break & which
<lb />has a very small & delicate grain, & which is found soft
<lb />when handling it between the fingers. And
<lb />because the latter is only found near the rocks in mountainous
<lb />areas or lean territories, & akin to the 
<lb />arene, it cannot be found <-in-> in the
<lb />surroundings of all the bonnes villes where

<lb />fall down to the bottom of the first vessel, but the one which
<lb />will have come from the troubled water, set apart, having
<lb />settled, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough
<lb />bond, grind it quite dry on porphyry, & you will
<lb />render it impalpable, & which will have bond like chalk.
<lb />Then, if it seems right to you, you will reheat it & again will grind it & mix it with salts, or linen, or burnt

<lb />the pathways of the gardens. And every two
<lb />years, they do not forget to open the sides of the
<lb />cases for trimming & dexterously cutting, with the soil,
<lb />the ends of the orange tree’s roots, because otherwise, as they
<lb />find the wood, they contract & fold back on themselves & dry at
<lb />the tips & would make the tree die. But as they are trimmed, it
<lb />preserves for them new space <-cos-> for expanding,
<lb />without finding resistance from the wood that hinders them. And know

<lb />Grafting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />With any tree that has coarser marrow, the graft is awkward
<lb />to <-be-> cut well, because there is a
<lb />danger of wounding the marrow, & if it is wounded at the point of
<lb />juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the vine, from all
<lb />peaches & apricots.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Apricot trees have a very thin bark, & thus one needs
<lb />to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
<lb />shoots of prune trees & almond trees.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The grafts scarcely <-[illegible]-> take if the cut of the tree is
<lb />wet. One needs then to graft in serain & mild
<lb />weather, & not too cold & windy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Old wood that one leaves to the graft is necessary if one grafts on a
<lb />tree that is already made & of good size, because being such, it
<lb />tightens the graft more, & if it is from young wood, it is so
<lb />compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
<lb />of old wood <-than the young-> better, because it is harder than
<lb />the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
<lb />beautifully, but turns fragile & short & slow to
<lb />grow.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molding with cuttlefish bone
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Guard against keeping them in a humid place, for they are
<lb />very prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the bone
<lb />in two, then even it out with a knife. And on a hooked
<lb />roof tile, quite dry & quite smoothed & covered with
<lb />pulverized willow charcoal, rub & smooth the two
<lb />halves of the bones. Thus they imbibe this willow
<lb />charcoal, which makes them release well & guards against removing
<lb />anything. Then, on a counter bone, that is to say a piece of
<lb />brick evened to the size of your bone, place
<lb />your medal, & then on this one, place the bone,
<lb />& press well with some other piece of the same size on the top. And for
<lb />the second time, mold it, but before, pounce on top with
<lb />willow charcoal & blow lightly, then press as before,
<lb />and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
<lb />whole bones. All cast work is brittle & subject to
<lb />breaking, because the metal expands when cast, & retracts
<lb />& condenses under the hammer. That is why one ought to
<lb />retrace the cast thing with a chisel, & in this way the
<lb />metal retracts. Let it thus escrouir. If the piece
<lb />for molding is of high relief, first trace the mold & hollow it
<lb />with a penknife to make way for the medal, & then
<lb />mold. And if the medal has two sides
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Before casting, heat the
<lb />bones in order to make them lose only the coldness &
<lb />moisture.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the lead gets too hot, it

<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f181" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />since the two bones are joined,
<lb /><-co-> cut them evenly all around, & make notches
<lb /><-e-> around it in different places which cross over the
<lb />join of the two bones, in order to recognize well the
<lb />place of the first join. Or else, with little shards of
<lb />wood, pierce them, or <-ma-> coat the
<lb />joins with some clay, & dry. Press, <-between them->
<lb />your hands joined between your two knees
<lb />& not with a press, because the bones would
<lb />crack. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see
<lb />that it is pressed quite tightly together & well imprinted. And each
<lb />time before replacing the piece, pounce with some
<lb />willow charcoal, for it makes it release well. When you
<lb />have cast, rub the medal with oil & with willow
<lb />charcoal powder & with a brush, to make it dull. Take care that your medal is not too greasy or oily when you mold in
<lb />cuttlefish bone. When you have cast, leave it
<lb />to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
<lb />brings with it some bone. And cast moderately hot,
<lb />which you will know when the bone is about to change
<lb />its <-good-> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it turns
<lb />the bone very red. The proportion of lead
<lb />& tin is as much of one as of the other. If the piece is difficult
<lb />to come out & of several pieces, make the gate forked with three or
<lb />four grooves, <-and-> <-make-> & direct these grooves to the
<lb />place of the thicker parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like straight on the heads, for this attracts the metal & feeds
<lb />the figure better. Shake your frame a little when you have cast,
<lb />and thus you will make very neatly several casts. Tin that is too
<lb />hot <-p->burns the bone, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
<lb />out <-from the mo-> hot from the mold, it risks
<lb />breaking.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin, which is
<lb />harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
<lb />it in one half of the frame & presses it a little so that
<lb />it holds better. And next, you will cast in your frame some
<lb />solder described above, or another more meltable than fine
<lb />tin. And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the
<lb />first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix
<lb />some lamp black with water &, with a
<lb />paintbrush, give a light coat of this to the medal, which
<lb />remains in the frame, & leave to dry. Thus it will not
<lb />melt.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />But if you have a medal of copper or silver, you can
<lb />leave it in the cast if you want to cast with lead or
<lb />tin. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold
<lb />would make the tin contract.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tin wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Soft tin, which is the best for the cast, is the
<lb />one that, once cast in grille, is <-burnished
<lb />&-> shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have
<lb />been burnished. And does not have holes like the one that is brittle &
<lb />that is not shiny as if burnished.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Potin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Potin, being cast hot, runs & flows like tin. But
<lb />the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately casts out the
<lb />verd, which a good material does not
<lb />do.

<lb />Congealing mercury
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
<lb />hours in a rather large iron pot,
<lb />putting in, for an ℥ of
<lb />☿, ii ℥ of
<lb />verdet <-of-> and vitriol of

<lb />water from farriers.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Or else, melt 4 ℥ of tin, & as
<lb />it cools, purify it of its filth, which is on top, then, make a
<lb />hole in it & put in this i ℥ of
<lb />☿ & it will come out like tin if you
<lb />remelt it, but it will be breakable. And if you want to assay if it is
<lb />tin or ☿, redden a shovel &
<lb />put a small piece of your ingot on top. If it is tin, it will melt
<lb />& stay, but if it is ☿, will quickly melt,
<lb />then, crackling quite strongly, it will take flight. One ought to congeal it in
<lb />a spoon or in a hollow crucible & make a
<lb />moderately sized hole.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in aquafortis which beforehand will have eaten a little silver.
<lb />This one, mixed, makes tin & lead run.

<ab>
<lb />Mixture
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Fine tin, congealed mercury with the smell of

<lb />Grafts
<lb />I
<lb />It is necessary that the graft be not from old wood, for it is never

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
<lb />it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, & it
<lb />does not have enough strength to bud.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Trees which have coarse marrow, like peach trees & all
<lb />their kind & plum trees, do not want grafts in
<lb />freezing weather because the cold damages their marrow, which one
<lb />also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
<lb />graft.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree is sapping,
<lb />for the humor grows them quickly. Otherwise

<lb />Face in distemper
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because colors in distemper dry promptly & one would not
<lb />have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets
<lb />the reverse of the face which is on canvas with a wet
<lb />sponge. Then, with a small paintbrush, one makes
<lb />the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
<lb />which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
<lb />again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
<lb />areas. And with another paintbrush, one redoes the shadows
<lb />by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
<lb />because they are made of bistre, which stains the canvas
<lb />like rust. The said bistre is good <-with-> for
<lb />making shadows in distemper <-mix->, for in oil it
<lb />has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
<lb />the said bistre, for shadow, ocre de ru & a [<-a->]
<lb />little sap green. The best bistre is the greasy &
<lb />shiny kind from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is
<lb />difficult to grind & screeches on the marble.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azure
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Azur d’esmail always wants to be cleaned, because the
<lb />filth that can be perceived in the wash water makes it die. One needs
<lb />to layer it two times, & the first very thick, moving the
<lb />paintbrush by layering it first lengthwise then across.
<lb /> It is better used on canvas, where it is imbibed
<lb />immediately, than on wood. Varnish returns it to its
<lb />vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To assay it,
<lb />painters bring their palette to the
<lb />grocers, & temper & alloy it with a little white
<lb />ground in oil, for in this way, the beautiful shows its
<lb />turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
<lb />delicate is the best for working. It is made finer <-working-> by
<lb />washing it.

<lb />Furbisher
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The parts of a sword are the rivet,
<lb />the tail of the sword, what comes next is the ricasso, the rest is
<lb />the <-c-> blade. The sides are the edge
<lb />& the point. Some blades have a sharp ridge<-r->,
<lb />which has one single elevated ridge in the middle & along the whole
<lb />length, and are easy to break. The other
<lb />blades are called of three edges or three slopes, which do have
<lb />a rise in the middle, but it is flat as if it were a sharp ridge, but
<lb />flattened, and <-s-> these
<lb />ones are the safest. The others <-are-> are called fluted, which
<lb />are notched in the middle, & when it is
<lb />along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those with
<lb />sharp ridges & are more troublesome to furbish because the
<lb />fustée cannot get in. But one makes one in particular which is
<lb />narrow.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Of the guard of the sword are the
<lb />pommel, the branches of the guard & the
<lb />pontet, which is this
<lb />iron strip which closes off the branch which is at the end of the
<lb />ricasso to stop thrusts from sliding into the guard. The
<lb />rings are these two branches in
<lb />half-round which start from the eye of the
<lb />guard up to the branch of the pontet. The branch that crosses
<lb />the guard is called the body. And this
<lb />quillon block, by which the sword
<lb />tail enters and to which all the branches
<lb />return & are held, is called the eye of the guard.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Then follows the wood of the grip, which one glues, or
<lb />according to the most competent, with gummed wax, which is of
<lb />wax & pitch, because rosin would be too hard.
<lb />They heat it lightly, then rub the wood of the grip with it in
<lb />order that the tang or the thread takes hold there. Otherwise, if a
<lb />thread were to come loose, it would all <-d->
<lb />break immediately. On iron wire or dog
<lb />skin, one also puts glue on
<lb />it. The garnishment <-of-> which is put on the wood
<lb /><-of->, which is of silk or thread, is called the
<lb />cord, which is made from two <-tro-> or three
<lb />threads <-turned-> twisted on the spinning wheel,
<lb />or 4 if the silk is thin. The slightly thicker cord holds better.
<lb />The binding, which is also made of silk at both ends of the
<lb />handle, are called the
<lb />buttons.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some grips are made of silk, dogfish
<lb />skin, annealed iron wire,
<lb />threads of gold & of fine & false silver & of
<lb />velvet. Iron wire has a lower price & is the most
<lb />durable. Next is the grip of silk, if one does not have the
<lb />convenience of being close to the sea to procure some
<lb />dog skin, which is quite
<lb />convenient. <-Pou-> The beautiful skin costs fifty or lx
<lb />sous & 4 or five dozen grips are
<lb />made from it. This kind gives a good grip even if the hand is
<lb />sweating. To work it, if it is too hard, one soaks it for one
<lb />or two hours in not quite lukewarm
<lb />aquafortis, for if it were too hot, it would cook & spoil the
<lb />skin. It is sewn with black thread.

<pb facs="#f187" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The gold grips are made by putting underneath thin yellow
<lb />canvas or a different canvas yellowed with chalk. And this
<lb />canvas is set with glue or the aforesaid gum, this
<lb />is in order that the thread holds better on it. These are made of
<lb />cords like the silk ones, & between two cords one sets one or
<lb />two threads to make it show up better. The silver kind is
<lb />made similarly, and there is not as much trouble as with silk,
<lb />and even less because it takes more to twist silk, because one
<lb />needs to twist it twice. A grip of fine gold is worth 18 or 20
<lb />sous.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The lower stick, which is folded like a bow, is called the

<lb />There is an iron which is made like a halberd point,

<lb />file on sword guards & to give an edge to swords after they
<lb />have been ground, which is better than with a stone or a

<lb />The furbisher buys his blades by the dozen, which
<lb />are not fully drawn by the tang because he does this himself to adjust
<lb />them well to the <-l-> pommel & guards.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spanish ones are deemed better for being of better steel
<lb />& iron, but they are not as well-forged as swords from
<lb />Vienne in <-pro-> Dauphiné. The
<lb />Spanish ones are not as well ground coming from the
<lb />forge, because they grind them with the
<lb />foot, & this is what
<lb />makes them wavy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Blades from Vienne commonly cost xviii or 19
<lb />lb a dozen.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The first thing the furbisher does when he gets his new
<lb />blades is to draw out their tang, which he does himself or has done by
<lb />locksmiths or farriers, giving him some
<lb />liard for his charcoal. Next, they
<lb />pass it over a grindstone to make it
<lb />cut, then lay it down on the
<lb />chameau, and with some pulverized
<lb />emery, fine & soft as flour, & mixed with oil
<lb />to make it hold, they furbish the sword with the stick used to
<lb />remove the traces of the grindstone, and then <-the->
<lb />clean the sword <-po->well with the
<lb />emery and give it a drop or two of oil, which
<lb />they spread with the finger to give it luster. Having
<lb />put the oil, they furbish the sword again on the
<lb />chameau with the
<lb />felin, which is a
<lb />thunderstone mounted in the middle of a stick like the
<lb />fustée, and this stick is called the baton à
<lb />felinder. Next, having passed it on the
<lb />felin, they furbish it with chalk &
<lb />the oil which is on the sword. Next, they wipe it & go over
<lb />it again, & furbish with dry chalk. And at the end, when they
<lb />are ready mounted, one gives them the edge with the
<lb />gratteau.
<lb /><-Ai->
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once furbished, one mounts it on the guards which one presents to
<lb />know if they are quite suitable. And taking hold of a blade such that
<lb />the whole ricasso is held in the hand, one conjectures
<lb />that it will be just as heavy once mounted.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One puts the blade in a vise between two pieces of
<lb />wood, then with a file, they enlarge the opening of the
<lb />guard if it is necessary. Then, to rivet it,
<lb />one places on the rivet <-a piece of->
<lb />& the pommel a piece of wood, & with a hammer,
<lb />one beats on it to align & secure the pommel well. Then, with the
<lb />hammer, one finishes the rivet when the pommel is well secured
<lb />& does not wobble. The wood is put there so as not to spoil
<lb />the pommel. Next, one finishes the rivet with a file or
<lb />chisel. And some make <-the b-> the rivet in a
<lb />square diamond-shape, but it is not as good
<lb />as the round one, for, when faceted, the rivet breaks.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />

<pb facs="#f189" />

<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The end is bought ready-made by the
<lb />dozen, which costs six sous for
<lb />the small ones, but for the the big ones 2
<lb />carolus. The end <-this-> is put either
<lb />with nails, which are put on the sides of the cutting edge, but
<lb />this only spoils the sword & destroys the scabbard because the
<lb />water enters through the joint of the nail. It is best to
<lb />apply some rosin or glue on it, but rosin is better.
<lb />And it is best when the end is well adjusted & set so hot that the
<lb />pulverized rosin melts on the end. In this way, it does not fall
<lb />and cannot be undone unless it is put in the fire.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Guards are of several kinds:
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Worked
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Guttered, which is with round moldings
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Pearled
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Scarfed, when the bands are crosswise
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Onioned, which is with a flat head
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In the King’s manner, which are plain
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The furbishers buy them by dozens, the
<lb />dozen of plain ones commonly costs x lb. The
<lb />worked piece, 30 sous or depending on its
<lb />fashion.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The first thing the apprentice does is to furbish as
<lb />said.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And next, to garnish the sword & make a scabbard, which is the
<lb />height of the art.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They buy the wood pieces of
<lb />beech wood for scabbards which are ready made, a hundred for xv or xx or 30
<lb />sous, depending on the distance from the place
<lb />where they are made.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />These wood pieces are thus called
<lb />estelles, and have to be
<lb />very neat & without any knots & are one finger’s
<lb />thickness across.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a
<lb />scabbard bench, and with a <-e->
<lb /><-plane-> small iron
<lb />tool similar to that of the joiners’ bench,
<lb />they make it hold firmly. Then, with a <-plane->
<lb />plane which is like a knife with two
<lb />handles, one works the wood
<lb />roughly from the top, next one passes the joiner’s
<lb />plane on it the better to even it. Next, one scours it on the
<lb />inside with a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f190" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />round plane, also mounted with two handles, then with a
<lb />small narrow plane, one hollows & scrapes it half a
<lb />foot toward the end of the
<lb />talan, and the shorter the better.
<lb />Without this scraping, the sword would always cut the scabbard.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth, & on top is the
<lb />shape of the blade.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The stop, which is a leather rim set on the edge of the blade
<lb />shape, is made to stop the hangers.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the estelles are well levelled, one lays the sword on top,
<lb />& with a black stone, one marks the width of the
<lb />blade & the length, & then with a chisel, one cuts the
<lb />excess. And one passes a joiner’s plane to even it
<lb />well, according to the mark.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Next, one glues the two estoilles edge to edge and all
<lb />around, only as far as the shape of the blade extends & not
<lb />elsewhere. And this is to make the leather or velvet of
<lb />the scabbard hold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Then one puts the sword into the estelles. And precisely thus,
<lb />they set it in the scabbard, which is all sewn, and rub what is
<lb />glued along the shape of the blade
<lb />with tallow to make it run into the scabbard.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The scabbard is made of calf or sheep leather,
<lb />the calf ones are all in one piece, but not the sheep
<lb />ones. But, when the swords are long, one makes them in pieces which are
<lb />sewn between leather & flesh, & then they rub the
<lb />stitching thoroughly with a piece of boxwood to
<lb />cover & even it. From a good calf skin, viii or 9 or
<lb />x scabbards can be taken. A
<lb />workman can easily make vi a day. If they
<lb />are too thick, one thins them a little with a plane. If the
<lb />skin is hard, one wets it in lightly lukewarm water, and
<lb />one does not leave it there for long. Next, the same
<lb />worker who made the wood piece has to adjust the
<lb />scabbard to be well made. It is true that for common people,
<lb />one may well get ones which are ready made, but they are never carried
<lb />as well. When the scabbard is made & sewn with black thread,
<lb />one rubs it with a piece of boxwood or with a
<lb />cloth, having daubed it a little in oil. The scabbard of
<lb />a good cow is better than any and also costs more, except the
<lb />velvet kind. Under the velvet, one commonly puts plain
<lb />canvas or a sheep scabbard or a parchment cover. But
<lb />the best scabbard of all is a waxed scabbard, of either
<lb />velvet or calf. It is because one covers the wood
<lb />with thin canvas, which one next waxes, then one covers it
<lb />in velvet or calf. A waxed scabbard is worth at
<lb />least xxx sous, a cow one xx
<lb />sous.

<ab>
<lb />Grey guards
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once they are white, one only needs to clean <-bi-> them
<lb />well, then put them in the fire, & make them pass to blue. And one
<lb />needs to take good care that they do not pass too far beyond blue, for
<lb />neither gold nor silver nor any color would take on it. To do this,
<lb />which is called making them pass, one takes
<lb />a cauldron full of ashes, which one covers with
<lb />thoroughly lit charcoal, & thus one heats them quite strongly for an
<lb />hour or two, and when the ashes are very hot,
<lb />one pulls the charcoal to one side & one puts the guard where the
<lb />charcoal was, & one covers it completely with ashes. And when
<lb />the body of the guard, which is the main thing, is completely passed,
<lb />one rotates the guard onto the other side, and in this manner, the grey
<lb />cannot pass too much, unless some hot charcoal touches it. The
<lb />grey can be done well in the <-d-> ordinary fire in the
<lb />fireplace, but there is a danger that it may pass too much &
<lb />produce filth, which will prevent it from taking color. Blue is
<lb />obtained as soon as the ash has heated the guards a little, but
<lb />it is still grey in some places. After blue comes grey.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Color of water
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For the color of water, one passes a soft file
<lb />on the guards to whiten them, then the burnisher. Next, one
<lb />makes them pass to blue until they turn grey. Next, when they are still
<lb />moderately hot, one passes the bloodstone over them, and when
<lb />they cool, one turns them to reheat them, for the color of water is made
<lb />only in several passes. And if the guards were not warm, the
<lb />bloodstone would scrape & undo the color. One needs to take
<lb />heed that the guards do not pass too far beyond grey, for they would throw
<lb />off filth that would prevent the color from taking. One needs almost one
<lb />day for preparing, smoothing & setting in the
<lb />color of water, but as they pass a little beyond blue, it is enough for
<lb />grey & another color. Grey is the lesser color after varnish,
<lb />which is of two colors, either yellow or black.

<lb />Gilding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very soft, file such that there
<lb />is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heats them,
<lb />& passes them as is said. But to gild
<lb />& gild with silver, they ought not to pass more than a little
<lb /> beyond blue. Then, while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a vise,
<lb />& with some tweezers, one layers the gold, & one
<lb />sets it with bloodstone that is quite clean & rubbed with
<lb />putty. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them,
<lb />then one layers the gold as above. And first, one gives
<lb /><-of-> two layers, until the entire guard is well-garnished. And
<lb />next, one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering
<lb />of gold. Then, one burnishes very thoroughly & with great
<lb />force with a large bloodstone. <-And-> But note that
<lb />for burnishing well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to
<lb />know this, one smells it & brings it close to the
<lb />nose. For one ought not to touch it with the
<lb />fingers, but one <-holds it on-> lifts it from on top of
<lb />the warm ashes with a small iron rod, which has
<lb />been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is
<lb />completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a white
<lb />linen cloth, and the gold needs to be thicker &
<lb />stronger than for painters. A quarteron is worth
<lb />fifty or lx sous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Gilding with silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a 
<lb /><-li[illegible]-> file, a little coarser
<lb /><-for-> than for gold. And one makes them pass beyond
<lb />grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
<lb />silver foil, then separate it with a knife; next, apply
<lb />it to the guard with <-a small-> tweezers
<lb />& a small burnisher. And then, reheat & apply until they
<lb />are all gilt with silver. Next, one needs to cover them for the
<lb />third time with the doubled foil, as has been said, then burnish them
<lb />very well & with force, not with the bloodstone but with a
<lb />strong burnisher. Just as the burnisher ought not to
<lb />burnish gold.

<lb />Mastic varnish dry in a half
<lb />hour
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some take 2 ℥ of mastic, a half ℥ of turpentine, & a half ℥ of
<lb />turpentine oil, & eau-de-vie, a little at your discretion 
<lb />because it evaporates when heated & nonetheless makes the varnish more desiccative. But I made
<lb />it thus: I take turpentine oil at discretion & put in a good
<lb />bit of turpentine, because it remains always humid & attaches
<lb />itself if one puts in too much, & eau-de-vie, & heat in a
<lb />varnished bowl the said oil, & when it begins to be
<lb />very hot, I put in some subtly ground mastic & passed through a sieve,
<lb /><-l-> around one-third of the oil,
<lb />and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on
<lb />hot ashes. Once all melted, try it on the knife, and if
<lb />you see that it has too much body, add in a little turpentine
<lb />oil, and if it does not have enough, add in mastic, and thus
<lb />it will be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When
<lb />you want to make it, be careful to sort & choose the mastic
<lb />that is white & purified of any dirt & dust & black dross.
<lb />And when you wash it & dry it to render it very white & clean,
<lb />it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these
<lb />straws & marks, pulverized into it, will remain
<lb />within the varnish, & when you set it on white or flesh color,
<lb />it will seem that they are fleas & blemishes. Once well
<lb />chosen, pulverize it in a mortar and pass it through a very
<lb />fine sieve, and next mix it in oil, as is said. But if you
<lb />want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of mastic, as you
<lb />know, pulverize, pass, & mix, and you will have something very
<lb />singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on
<lb />it, for this will make the varnish whiten & take body.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It almost dries when working.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One knows that this varnish does not have body enough when it
<lb />does not take well on a panel in oil, for it is like water.
<lb />Therefore, add in pulverized mastic & heat until it is good.
<lb />This varnish is very white & beautiful, & does not go to
<lb />your head like that of spike lavender.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For some, instead of <-tour-> turpentine oil, put
<lb />spike lavender oil, which is not as good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This varnish is laid down cold on the panel with a very clean
<lb />fingertip, & one needs to spread it

<lb />make it boil in vinegar, then they wipe it well with a

<lb />rosin over the top, which coats it with a shiny skin like
<lb />varnish. This done, they melt some pure & fine tin in
<lb />their estamiere, which is a little square iron
<lb />box. And when the tin is well melted & moderately warm, they
<lb />throw in rosin to burn the filth, & then they let the
<lb />head of a nail or something similar soak a little, & having
<lb />remained there for seven or eight pauses, they take
<lb />it out and shake it, hitting the top with an iron to
<lb />make the tin that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a
<lb />small stick wrapped in tow. And if it is not well
<lb />tinned, you will rub it hot with a piece of rosin & do
<lb />as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow,
<lb />which is a sign that the tin is the right temperature. But it
<lb />becomes blue if the tin is too hot. Things <-t->

<lb />To cast carefully, one ought not to take metals already

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Iron hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is better to mold all with one sand, be it in a frame or

<ab>
<lb />One ought to reheat for one or two hours <-and 
<lb />p->, in a fire <-that-> of charcoal which
<lb />lights by itself, a crucible with the substance inside, and
<lb />then blow & cover the crucible with large charcoals
<lb />& the mouth of the furnace with bricks, and
<lb />let it consume two or three feedings of charcoal, which
<lb /><-se-> fill the furnace above the
<lb />crucible. At the end, stoke it to a violent fire, & when the
<lb />flame is very white & the substance is in a liquid
<lb />bath like water & casting off pale blue flames,
<lb />cast. The secret is to cast very hot & in one go.
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lean white sand without bond renders quite 
<lb />proper for casting, &, having body, if
<lb />you grind it very finely on porphyry or calcine it,
<lb />reddening it several times in the fire, & spread it in
<lb />vinegar or finely grind it with water, as you know. It
<lb />also molds very neatly en noyau, as I have experimented. But do
<lb />not moisten it with salt water if you want to promptly reheat it,
<lb />for salt boils on the fire & makes pustules, being pressed by
<lb />the fire. I believe that the noyaulx, gently reheated, would not
<lb />do this. I molded very neatly en noyau the substance of
<lb />skillets. White sand smells like sulfur when
<lb />reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
<lb />cast in it, it acquires in the mold
<lb /><-as-> a luster as if it were
<lb />leaded or vitrified. I believe that glassmakers could
<lb />use it.

<lb />boring, because the substance is cast & expands &

<lb />+

<lb />pure copper, and grind them until they become very fine
<lb />& soft powder, and this is a sign that they have taken the substance

<lb />Heat linseed oil on a gentle fire without letting

<lb />much of the newest wax you can. Once melted, let it cool, &
<lb />once they begin to curdle, stir continuously with a new
<lb />wooden spatula <-t-> for as long as it takes
<lb />you to say <-one-> 9 paternoster, and as you say them,
<lb />wash this composition with holy water, stirring all the while.
<lb />Having said the s first 9 paternoster, pour out the
<lb />first water & put in new one, & wash & stir the
<lb />composition for the time it takes you to say 8 paternoster, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, & thus
<lb />you will consecutively <-until-> add new water, doing the
<lb />same as above, until the last & single paternoster of
<lb />nine. Then you shall have a soft & white ointment, with which
<lb />you shall anoint the burn for the space of 9 days.
<lb />But do not apply it any longer than this, for it would cause
<lb /><-a-> your flesh to grow excessively. You
<lb /><-p-> shall bandage yourself twice a day,
<lb />& each time you shall wash your face with water
<lb />& wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as if
<lb />pressing with a wet linen cloth, and you shall wipe it similarly
<lb /><-aff-> with a fine linen cloth, & next put
<lb />the ointment, over which you can put ivy leaves.

<lb />For shield grafting, one needs to take the new issue
<lb />that the tree that you want to graft has made in that year, &
<lb />there cut a branch on which you see that next to
<lb /><-raci-> the sprouting of leaves there are little
<lb />buttons that one calls œillets, which are the beginnings of
<lb />sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a very sharp penknife, cut
<lb />in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin <-with-> which
<lb />contains an œillet or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.
<lb /><-But-> <-plusto-> Then, carefully make on the
<lb />tender wood, <-s-> which is in sap, on which you
<lb />want to graft, two lines thus <-de-> cut 
<lb />, then
<lb />make in the middle a cleft thus .
<lb />Next, separate, with the point of the penknife, the bark &
<lb />open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
<lb />shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well & wrap
<lb />it entirely with a slip of linen or very
<lb />soft thread, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
<lb />which in three or 4 days will give you an indication
<lb />whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
<lb />graft seven or eight days thus, then unbind it &
<lb />join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, & then rebind
<lb />all gently but not as strongly as before; & if there is any output
<lb />or growth, leave it space to go out, & do thus three or 4
<lb />times.

<lb />Next, when it is well <-b-> taken, cut the top
<lb />of the tree that exceeds your tree, <-ne-> three or 4
<lb />fingers above the shield for the first time, and
<lb /><-apr-> then, at the closest point, in order that it
<lb />closes. But heed well that when you make your shield no small hole
<lb />remains at the back of the sprout, for this would signify to you that
<lb />its root would be broken, & your graft would never take; but make it
<lb />so that the back is intact. This type of grafting is practiced
<lb />from mid-May, so that the trees have already budded

<lb />trees, which by their nature are drier, lose their sap earlier, therefore
<lb />those who want to graft onto them mericotons,
<lb />apricots & grafts of trees with pitted fruit, which are the
<lb />best there, they are grafted in the month of
<lb />January. Generally trees with pitted fruit, like

<ab>
<lb />Aspalte <-is-> which is found in Germany
<lb />is the most excellent sand one can find for molding in a frame,
<lb />because it is appropriate for silver & for gold, &
<lb />the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. One molds in
<lb />it very thinly & finely.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Making gold run for casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because gold cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a
<lb />mixture when <-melted q-> it is well melted which maintains
<lb />the heat. Sublimate softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in
<lb />smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore, mix this composition when
<lb />you want to cast: sal ammoniac, the best verdet
<lb />that you can find, a little borax & saltpeter
<lb /><-which li->. And this, by keeping it warm, it
<lb />will come out neatly. Saltpeter clarifies it &
<lb /><-p-> heats it. But the most important thing in this
<lb />mixture is the verdet, which has to be good. This
<lb />mixture softens the gold <-qui-> so much that it
<lb />becomes tractable like lead, even fine gold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For sand for molding flowers & leaves & delicate things, mix
<lb />in ground raw plaster, brick & feather alum.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To moisten sands, eau-de-vie is excellent, for it
<lb />grinds the sand finely & goes in exhalation <-que-> when one
<lb />reheats the frames.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sal ammoniac water is very good, is excellent, for moistening
<lb />sands, but for lots of water, one only needs a little sal
<lb />ammoniac.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />A loop of iron, for lack of crocum ferri, is
<lb /><-exce-> good for gold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The snakes or lizards you want to mold should not
<lb />be kept for a long time, for if they are alive, they get
<lb />thin, and if they are <-dry il-> dead, they wither.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster of Paris is as firm as stone &
<lb />very good. When you want to choose some for your sand, take it raw,
<lb />the hardest possible & which does not make any powder. The
<lb />transparent one and the one that thus makes powder retracts,
<lb /><-Which-> which is not good for this work. A sign of the
<lb />one that is close to perfection is that it is hard & made of
<lb />lustrous grains nearing the shape of sugar. Finally, to mix some
<lb />into the sand to cast gold, it is necessary that it endures the
<lb />fire twice & is reheated twice.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
<lb />When gold is very fine, it is so dry that it
<lb />can hardly endure a hammer, but this mixture softens it like
<lb />lead.

<lb />The shell of crabs & crayfish are
<lb />awkward to burn, & there is a proper fashion of molding them.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Rats & birds can be molded, and the feet are

<lb />Reheated plaster <-se ga-> as is said here, keeps

<ab>
<lb />

<lb />        
<lb />It must withstand the fire & turn red like a lit

<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the plaster is mixed with some dust or is not the
<lb />hard kind, it bursts in the fire & causes flashing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The hardest plaster, as was said, is the best
<lb />when it is from stone, therefore take it raw of this kind. Pestle it
<lb /><-well-> as finely as possible,
<lb />and pass it through the finest sieve or sleeve that
<lb />you can. <-A-> Being thus <-p-> fine, put it
<lb />in a good amount in a cauldron or
<lb />skillet over an open flame, & as it begins to heat up, stir
<lb />it continuously, and heavy & coarse as it is, it will become so light
<lb />& so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance
<lb />to <-handling-> stirring, as if it were water.
<lb />Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy
<lb />& dense, and that is the sign that it is cooked. But do not reheat
<lb />it until your brick and [<-feather->] feather alum are
<lb />reheated & the clay circles are made. For it needs to be the
<lb />last one reheated & when all the rest is ready, for the less
<lb />plaster #

<ab>
<lb />Feather alum is the one that gives good
<lb />binding to sand.

<lb />Crocum ferri is appropriate for

<lb /># remains reheated, & <-more->
<lb />the more quickly it is

<lb />to reheat it until
<lb />you want to
<lb />mold. And to 
<lb />reheat it, put it,
<lb />as finely ground raw powder,
<lb />in a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />cauldron on <-ash->
<lb />a clear flame, & do not make it either too strong nor
<lb />too violent. Always stir with a long stick to avoid the vapor,
<lb />turning it around the cauldron & in the middle, in a figure
<lb />8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <-difficult-> to
<lb />stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
<lb />throw off some bubbles at the edge of the cauldron. And finally,
<lb />it will become like liquid &, as it were, mealy & like bran & boiling in
<lb />the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
<lb />has once again become heavy

<lb />as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste, & that it is
<lb />not so easy to handle as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
<lb />cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws off big bubbles or
<lb />exhalations, in the middle & around, as long as a
<lb />finger. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
<lb />fire, for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
<lb />would be too much & would not set as well. For when it becomes red
<lb />& overheats, it loses its strength & spoils the sand. Leave it
<lb />to cool before mixing it with the other sands. And when it is cold,
<lb />mix and mold, for the sooner after its cooking you use it, the
<lb />sooner it will set.

<lb />Catching lizards and snakes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a stick and attach a string at the end which
<lb />has a <-knot-> <-eyelet-> slip
<lb />eyelet at the end. And there being two or three to distract the
<lb />lizard by whistling, approach the eyelet toward its neck,
<lb />and when its head [<-l->] is inside, pull. The lizard is more
<lb />tedious to catch by hand than the snake &
<lb />bites without letting go & grips like pincers.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Snakes can be caught by hand, provided
<lb />that it is covered by a thick woollen cloth, for the
<lb />teeth of the snake stay in the cloth & cannot
<lb />pierce like they would with a linen. The dangerous ones are
<lb />recognized by their blue & <-asses-> aseures
<lb />azure eyes. They hardly ever bite in
<lb />water, which crayfish catchers
<lb />experience.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The sand mixture is of two parts of plaster, pulverized
<lb />& reheated as said, & of one part of tile,
<lb />reddened <-and p-> <-pre-> in a good
<lb />fire after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of
<lb />feather alum, half as much as of the brick, namely two
<lb />full crucibles of plaster, one of brick
<lb />& a half of feather alum. There can never be too
<lb />much feather alum, for <-s-> this is
<lb />what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand
<lb />withstand the fire without cracking & bursting. Otherwise, without
<lb />it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper
<lb />for all metals, but if you want to use it for gold, one
<lb />needs more feather alum <-&-> than the aforesaid 
<lb />composition, and mix in some crocum ferri. For it is this one that attracts gold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well,
<lb />withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands
<lb /><-abon-> <-c-> a great firing without
<lb />getting spoiled.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Feather alum is awkward to pestle, and it does not
<lb />pass through the sieve. Thus, one needs to grind it finely on
<lb />marble. And the white one <-that v->
<lb />in powder that apothecaries sell is good. It is
<lb />ground better <-su-> in the mortar by pestling
<lb />& dragging the pestle, thus you will render it very
<lb />fine.

<lb />Crocum ferri must be set ablaze in a

<lb />days.

<lb />Molds can only be used once because for
<lb />delicate things, like wormwood & others, one needs to break
<lb />them, but before one [<-them->] needs to dip them well into water in which
<lb />the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be
<lb />able <-f-> to release your work without danger of
<lb />spoiling it.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Good feather alum is white and has a luster as
<lb />of white <-c-> silk. It is in pieces
<lb />long as a finger, & is very breakable & wooly
<lb />as down. The one made of stone is harder & not so
<lb />good. <-It-> The best of the aforesaid quality is
<lb />fetched in France, near Rouan. The feather alum for our sand is pestled in a mortar and is
<lb />further ground on marble, especially since one
<lb />cannot think of passing it finely through the sieve, for it is
<lb />so fat & wooly that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
<lb />its small soft <-which-> & thin filaments, which gives
<lb />binding to the sand in a much more excellent fashion than
<lb />cloth shearings in the founder’s earth of the founders
<lb />of great works, because these cloth shearings &
<lb />cloth waste burn and feather alum <-not-> resists the
<lb />fire.
</ab>

<lb />To enclose the molds, when you <-em-> throw
<lb />onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make <-your-> a circle

<ab>
<lb />When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the

<lb />the animal is curved or folded, one ought to make the core of
<lb />several pieces.

<ab>
<lb />Test whether distilled vinegar is
<lb />appropriate for eating away & dissolving what will be in the animal

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you know that your plaster is not strong enough to withstand
<lb />the fire without cracking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the
<lb />mixture put here that sometimes you <-mecties-> would
<lb />not diminish the quantity of feather alum
<lb /><-l-> a little bit, for it softens the
<lb />molds with its softness. Once reheated, do not pulverize it on
<lb />this occasion as fine as said, but leave it as the
<lb />apothecaries have ground it, for it does not hinder the
<lb />neatness of the cast & gives more binding. When the <-sand->
<lb />mold, <-being-> having set, retains the color of brick and is reddish, it is firmer.

<ab>
<lb />To hold the cores, some use wire of the same
<lb />metal that they cast because it reduces <-with-> &
<lb />melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the
<lb />core changes, some find it better to <-r-> use
<lb />iron wire, sharpened at the ends, because it holds
<lb />firmer & having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of
<lb />a needle. And one can apply gold or silver before using
<lb />it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small
<lb />chisel.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Eau-de-vie prevents the sand from becoming porous & does
<lb />not make little holes on the edges of the mold if the thing to
<lb />mold is well moistened with it. The holes & blisters & bubbles
<lb />are not made on the side of the mold, which is thick, but at
<lb />the edges, which are thinner.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One casts with common silver, with which goldsmiths
<lb />commonly work, which alloys <-And qua-> indifferently.
<lb />And when one were to cast with solder, it would run even
<lb />better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spat is a whitish stone which can
<lb />be found in Germany, & mainly in Augsburg, which
<lb />one uses for the most excellent sand that can be found for lead,
<lb />tin, copper, silver & gold. And the more
<lb />it is used, the better it is. It is appropriate for casting flat things
<lb />in a frame. For round things, it is not as fitting nor does
<lb />it hold in the fire as well as the aforesaid one made with
<lb />plaster.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The shreds of <-cui-> thick, greasy leather
<lb />are <-p->good to cast in the molten
<lb />copper and latten, for it cleans it & removes from it all its
<lb />filth. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spalt
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Spalt is white like cooked plaster and can be found in
<lb />mounds and stones formed in long scales & long veins. It is
<lb />very soft, such that with a fingernail one can scrape
<lb />it, & makes a powder like our chalk from Champagne.
<lb />And because everything which comes from [<-s->] the earth is mixed
<lb />with some other substance, to purify it, one grinds it, coming from the
<lb />quarry, quite coarsely, then one mixes it with sal
<lb />ammoniac water. <-M-> By putting in a piece the size of a
<lb />walnut in a large bottle of water, and
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f215" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />thus one mixes it & reduces it into
<lb /><-p-> small stones, purging it of its
<lb />impurities. Then, one puts it to cook neatly in a
<lb /><-pot-> earthen vessel in
<lb />the fornaise of those who make pots, and one
<lb />leaves it there until the pots are cooked. Next, one mixes it
<lb />again with sal ammoniac water & one grinds it very well,
<lb />and one empties the muddy & clean water into a separate
<lb />vessel. Again, one puts the same water on top &
<lb />one grinds, & again one puts the muddy water with the other.
<lb />And one does thus, until it has passed everything. In this way, one
<lb />purges & cleanses it, & one renders it very fine &
<lb />handleable. Having taken away the water by tilting it or with a
<lb />sponge, one takes the residue and one dries it. Then,
<lb />moistening it with the aforesaid water, like one does with
<lb />the other <-water-> sand, one uses it in a
<lb />frame, where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it
<lb />has not reheated enough & that one needs to reheat it further. This
<lb />one is appropriate for molding all metals, and especially
<lb />gold & silver, and the more it is used, the better it
<lb />is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast lead or
<lb />tin, for it would sour the gold you would cast in it.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Feather alum should be reheated in a
<lb /><-cauldron-> crucible covered
<lb />with a tile in a strong <-flame->
<lb />fire of charcoals, in order that the impurity which could be there
<lb />burns with the feather alum, which does not burn. This is done either in the
<lb />goldsmith’s forge, surrounded with
<lb />bricks, or in a fourneau à vent with
<lb />fusion fire, so that the <-sand remains long enough-> 
<lb />crucible for a
<lb />quarter of an hour remains red. This is done more to cleanse it
<lb />than for anything else. It becomes reddish on the surface & on the
<lb />inside it remains white & better dried out. #
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />#
<lb />After your feather alum is cooled,
<lb />pestle it in a mortar, then grind it on marble, and it will be rendered into very fine wooly
<lb />filaments which give bond to the sand without getting burned as
<lb />other things do, which is a beautiful invention. Pestle it in the
<lb />mortar by dragging the pestle, for the flying dust
<lb />could enter your throat or land on your face, which
<lb />will give you reason to scratch yourself well. Put it in the mortar a little
<lb />at a time to avoid the flying dust. It is
<lb />better
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />to grind it thus, in the mortar, dragging the
<lb />pestle, than on marble,
<lb /><-for-> where <-c-> it spreads, & in
<lb />the mortar, it collects on all sides. Render it very fine &
<lb />soft to the touch.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Clay to make circles around molds should
<lb />be very fatty & handleable, and serves only to make the surrounding of
<lb />the molds. Thus, one ought only to choose the quite fatty kind, and beat
<lb />very well, & moisten it moderately with some water, & keep
<lb />it in a pit or in a terrine, and make numerous
<lb />holes with a stick in it, which fill with water, in
<lb />order to keep it always fresh & soft, so that it is always ready to use
<lb />when you need it.

<lb />Modeling in wax

<lb />When wax is too hard, one mixes in turpentine or a

<lb />Wax for molding -
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />As the wax is melted, they have sulfur that is
<lb />melted in a spoon or crucible, & they pour some
<lb />in the melted wax. And going to the bottom or
<lb />remaining on top, the sulfur leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the
<lb />wax & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that
<lb />having molded, it melts in the mold gently like butter, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be advised not to give it too strong a fire.

<lb />In order that your mold grips without repelling in any place on

<lb />Anoint well, very lightly, with oil, so little that it hardly

<lb />It is better that they should be fixed through the blast-pipe in some piece of

<lb />can keep them in a barrel full of bran or even better of
<lb />earth, in a cool place, or in a glass
<lb />bottle. And give them any live frog or other little live animal,
<lb />for they do not eat anything dead. Also, I have noticed that

<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with a
<lb />direct attack but with sinuous turns & from the side, as do
<lb />Satan & his disciples. It has a small head but
<lb />a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small & inconsequential,
<lb />but the consequences of it are very great. It abstains from eating seven
<lb />or eight days, once it has devoured some
<lb />frog. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the
<lb />other, and what it devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go
<lb />in its stomach, but <-p-> some part little by little,
<lb />that is to say bones and everything. And the remains are found as fresh
<lb />as when it had devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses
<lb />& torments it, it renders up what it has engulfed, parts of which
<lb />are found totally consumed & others as fresh as if it were alive. It
<lb />can keep a frog
<lb />engulfed for two to three hours & renders it up completely alive.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Toad
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, & if you want to make
<lb />it have an open mouth, put some cotton inside, & then on the
<lb />cotton some melted wax.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If by chance you want to mold this vile animal, & if it were to
<lb />piss in your hand, it would burn your hand
<lb />& itch, as if you had handled nettles. But the most
<lb />powerful remedy for this is to put your hand into
<lb />fresh earth & to cover it as if you wanted to bury it.
<lb />A frog is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin,
<lb />& the other has a lumpy one.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can mold it hollow, and leaving under its belly an open notch, you
<lb />will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. Or else, if
<lb />it is small, put it on a magnet of its size, cut thinly, then
<lb />put it in good vinegar.

<ab>
<lb />Killing snakes for molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some put a drop of aquafortis in the mouth,

<lb />seem to be dead but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it
<lb />with a needle to fit it to the mold, it moves &
<lb />spoils & undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it
<lb />in a bottle of good vinegar & some eau-de-vie. And do thus with lizards & other similar
<lb />beasts.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to keep them, you can put them in a pipe full of
<lb />earth in a garden outdoors. But your pipe
<lb />must be covered with archal wire, for otherwise it would

<lb />Rock & grotto
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to pestle white & yellow marcasites &
<lb />diverse kinds of minerals, & then wash them well, in
<lb />order that the earthy & powdery part is cleaned & there remains
<lb />only the lustrous grain of the mineral, with which you will
<lb />sprinkle your rock previously covered with strong glue, 
<lb />if your <-fatty-> grotto is

<ab>
<lb />Snakes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When they feel taken, they hardly bite & do not have the power
<lb />to harm, unless they are really big snakes. The main thing is
<lb />to keep from being bitten before catching them, and having put your
<lb />foot on top of it, as close to the neck as one can,
<lb />one needs to grab it closest to the head, for it cannot bite if it does
<lb />not have the means to stretch its neck & make a sinuous &
<lb />oblique turn, & it cannot <-s-> harm with a direct
<lb />attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but writhes in
<lb />the shape of an S. I saw that the one who taught me to mold
<lb />them did not take this into account, & assured me that there
<lb />was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a
<lb />little pressed & held tightly by the neck, & passing it under a
<lb />shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render
<lb /><-under-> from its bottom, which is five to six [<-t->]
<lb />fingers from the end of its tail, all nasty and
<lb />venomous things that it had in its belly, and that after this, it does
<lb />not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel
<lb />through its bottom some filth, he would only dig the
<lb />earth with a knife, & bury his
<lb />hand in fresh & humid earth, which, when
<lb />applied fresh <-en-> on the infected part,
<lb />pulls out all the venom and nothing else. It is the same with
<lb />toad’s venom, which I have seen experimented. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In three, it is almost as thin as it will be afterward if it does not eat.
<lb />Molding it very soon after it is caught is best, before it becomes thin. One
<lb />ought to put it to death only a quarter of an hour before you want
<lb />to mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />

<pb facs="#f219" />

<lb />

<ab>
<lb />When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it renders it up.
<lb />And if, after having eaten something, it is thus pressed
<lb />underfoot, this pains it greatly & hurts it. If it
<lb />is wounded, it will not eat willingly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />There is nothing better for opening them up than to anoint them with
<lb />olive oil, & nothing else. And next, when you
<lb />want to unjoin them, soak them in cold water, which is the
<lb />secret. <-L-> And you will see that the
<lb />oil, although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like
<lb />grease. Molds become stronger in cold water. And hot
<lb />water would dissolve them awkwardly, although once reheated, they
<lb />are more handleable & easier to dissolve in the
<lb />water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Wheat oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Is made on a blade of iron reddened in the fire. And
<lb />the oil drips off, which is appropriate for anointing the hair of
<lb />a butterfly or similar thing, for this oil is instantly
<lb />dry & makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or
<lb />down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for being upright, it
<lb />would elevate the sand & become porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />#
<lb />If you want to mold
<lb />something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give it a little
<lb />thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with butter. But it
<lb />is best to anoint it with wheat oil, for it has no body,
<lb />& does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the
<lb />flower firm.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast of lead and tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because tin wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal,
<lb />plant, or other thing for molding is <-espe-> thin &
<lb />fine, do it so that there is more tin, much more than
<lb />lead, namely less than the fourth part lead for three
<lb />parts tin. And still, one puts lead only to form an
<lb />alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong &
<lb />thick, put a lot more lead in than tin. And in one &
<lb />the other you can put a little looking-glass tin, but only a
<lb />little, with a little rosin, when you want to cast. Since
<lb />then, when molding with fine and new lead, I put into one
<lb />lb two ounces of fine tin. And when molding
<lb />with fine tin, I put in two ℥ of fine lead
<lb />for one lb. I made plants & snakes just like

<lb />Reheating molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The frames readily dry out & do not reheat. For
<lb />reheating is actually <-for the second time-> to redden &
<lb />inflame the molds in the fire, and drying out is to let the
<lb />molds dry themselves or to make their humidity evaporate by
<lb />placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one.
<lb />Noyau molds readily reheat & frame molds

<lb />Latten smoke

<ab>
<lb />It is good to reheat in it the molds for casting latten,

<lb />Clay earth
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is
<lb />necessary for you to make the contour for containing your

<lb />half dry, that <-il->it does
<lb />not attach to your hands, because otherwise
<lb />it would attach to your work. Always keep it in a humid place,
<lb />and make holes in it, and fill them with water to keep it

<ab>
<lb />You also need to have provision of different sizes,
<lb />according to the molds that you want to make; thick
<lb />like cord, smaller [illegible], & thin <-p->,
<lb />like the thick strings of a spinet, for the small works. Once <-de-> reheated, you
<lb />make clamps from it to close the
<lb />molds, & points, like needles of different lengths,
<lb />according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it
<lb />held down. Needles would not be good for this because their points have to be empty & of the same thickness
<lb />throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as
<lb />you have need of. Iron wire is firmer than that of

<lb />The small lizards that one takes in the summer, the

<lb />Composition of sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once everything is reheated as said above, take four 4 full

<lb />& one of feather alum. Do not pass through the
<lb />sieve to mix <-may-> because the
<lb />alum would not pass. Mix with your
<lb />hands until neither one nor the other, neither white
<lb />nor red, can be discerned among the other. If your plaster were not
<lb />strong, do not mix in at all so much feather alum, because
<lb />it softens the molds. Take heed also that your sand is not hot
<lb />(since it has immediately been reheated) <-C-> when you
<lb />will want to mix it with water, for this <-them->
<lb />makes molds too soft & breakable.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You may sometimes diminish the quantity of plaster if you do not
<lb />find it strong enough to withstand fire & if it cracks,
<lb /><-&-> in order that the part of pestled tiles holds up, with
<lb />the feather alum, which you can also increase so that
<lb />it creates a better bond.

<lb />For tempering sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You need to have a big basin full of water to
<lb /><-q-> soak the molds to open them, a

<lb />lead bowl for tempering your sand, a small
<lb />wooden spoon to collect the wetted sand in the

<ab>
<lb />For molding en noyau. Mixture of sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having reheated your sand, namely the plaster, the
<lb />feather alum & the brick, & having
<lb />passed them finely through the sieve,
<lb />#, mix them this way: take four parts of
<lb />plaster, two of brick, & one of feather alum. Mix them all together with your hands
<lb /><-that it-> in such a way that one cannot discern one from
<lb />the other. With your sand ready, you need to put to death the animal that you
<lb />want to mold <-de->, in this manner.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />#
<lb />except for the feather alum, which
<lb />should be ground in a mortar
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Putting to death the animal for molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You need to be careful not to wound it in taking it. And, having put
<lb />it in a glass bottle <-d-> with
<lb />bran, or in a barrel <-full-> half full of
<lb />fresh & humid earth, if you want to store them or keep them a
<lb />long time, give them live frogs & not dead ones
<lb />to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &
<lb />grow thin & have long wrinkled <-aulx-> skins. Thus the best would be to
<lb />mold it as soon as <-after-> possible
<lb /><-apre-> after it has been taken. But before, put it to
<lb />death in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so
<lb />that it would collect no dust. And put inside such a quantity of good
<lb />vinegar & urine that it can be covered. And shake it
<lb />& torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in an hour or a half. But if you are in a
<lb />hurry
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take
<lb />it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
<lb />& when piercing it, it would draw back & spoil the mold.

<lb />

<ab>
<lb />to cast, make him take through the mouth some good eau-de-vie or else mix a little with the vinegar. And soon it will
<lb />be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
<lb />whom one would need a lot of eau-de-vie, one uses
<lb />vinegar and <-er-> urine. But for small
<lb />ones, only eau-de-vie, which is done sooner.
<lb />When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it carefully of its
<lb />old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like
<lb />lizards have, and then arrange it thus.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Now, put enough in a glass, & soak & continually keep in it
<lb />the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
<lb />big.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take heed, before it dies, to keep the eyes open <-es->
<lb />by blocking the eyelids with a little bit of wax or something
<lb />else.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-Molding-> Making the arrangement and disposition
<lb />of the animal
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having made provision of fatty earth called
<lb />clay, that should be grey because that commonly is the best, or
<lb />another which has good binding & which should be well prepared &
<lb />beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
<lb />hands nor the work, make a lasagna or like a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />cake of this earth equally flattened with a round
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />stick which pastry makers use, which should be a little
<lb />thicker than a thumb. And on this
<lb />cake, arrange your animal, <-aya->
<lb />imitating in that its nature & <-fa-> the fashion in
<lb />which it commonly turns itself. And first, with a good needle,
<lb />pierce it from underneath in the middle of the throat & up to
<lb /><-u[illegible]-> the top bone of the head. Retract the
<lb />needle, & in its place & its hole, put the point of
<lb />an iron wire of such a length that it suffices to hold the
<lb />head of the animal as <-q-> high as it must be, & if
<lb />the skin moves into the inside <-&-> when you put in the
<lb />point
<lb />, pull it out with <-a->
<lb /><-point-> the edge of your small pincers, &
<lb />arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the
<lb />cake of clay. Thus, the head will be held high,
<lb />which will have better grace, & being secured, next, arrange the gesture
<lb />of the body & the feet & the entanglement as you think will
<lb />look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you
<lb />cast in the sand, <-put-> secure the legs
<lb /><-& the corp-> with little points of iron
<lb />wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
<lb />needle. Do the same on the body parts that you will deem necessary,
<lb /><-arranging-> making sure that the points
<lb />passing through the animal are fixed in the cake of earth
<lb />and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
<lb />by a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a fine needle of steel, & which is the sharpest
<lb />possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the points
<lb />of iron, it passes without forcing anything, & by its
<lb />roughness does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
<lb />point of iron in thick places & thin ones in thin
<lb />places. But heed as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
<lb />point passed through the animal in the slab of earth,
<lb /><-for-> but having planted it, take it out of the
<lb />earth & not out of the animal, & <-do ains-> 
<lb />next, fix it. This is done because, by fixing it the
<lb />first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake, and by taking
<lb />the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you put again the points you have already used, clean them
<lb />well of rust so that they do not take away some skin.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The principal disposition of your arrangement is to <-di-> place
<lb />the head raised & looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
<lb />on a solid plank or table <-& [illegible]->, making the
<lb />point pass through the bottom of the throat,
<lb /><-s’arrestan-> entering into the top of the head,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f224" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />bit, <-qua-> so that <-t-> you can
<lb />take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
<lb />these points be of the most delicate iron wire possible
<lb />which can support the size of the animal. For the more delicate it is, the
<lb />smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs 
<lb />different thicknesses of these, because <-il->
<lb /><-de-> the points which are put in the body
<lb />& in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer &
<lb />stronger than the ones of the legs & thin parts, where the
<lb />needles ought to be subtle & delicate, almost like the
<lb />thickest strings of spinets. And it is better that they
<lb />be of iron wire, which is firmer than the one of latten.
<lb />And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg, ought to be
<lb />joined to the body, do not put the point there, not to corrupt
<lb />it. But place wax, as much as a grain of
<lb />millet, between the body & <-ce->
<lb /><-which-> the end of the tail, then with a bit of
<lb />flattened & hot iron wire, touch this wax & join
<lb />by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the
<lb />cake shaped like a mandore, place all around a
<lb />circle of the same
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />earth, in this way,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
<lb /> b & join everything well together in a circle, then, with a
<lb />big knife, with which you have cut your cake to
<lb />the right size, trim the outside which exceeds it, & place there a
<lb />piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a small curved
<lb />instrument, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want
<lb />to give to the mold, which will be for a common snake
<lb />as thick as two thumbs, in order that when you
<lb />cast in your wetted sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
<lb />this carefully arranged, moisten well everywhere with good eau-de-vie, with a paintbrush, the body of the animal
<lb />which is uncovered. For there is the secret, <-of the most->
<lb />kept well hidden, because everything that will be <-v->
<lb />touched by eau-de-vie will undoubtedly come out very
<lb />neatly & without <-porosity-> any small eyes or holes
<lb />that one calls porosity, which usually come not at the back & in the
<lb />thick sides of the mold, but on the edges. And as soon as you
<lb />have thus moistened everything with eau-de-vie, cast
<lb />in your wetted sand without letting the eau-de-vie dry,
<lb />which evaporates promptly. And wet it thus.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />and make sure that the point is longish, depending on how much you want to elevate the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
<lb />thus, plant your snake on the slab of earth, &
<lb />arrange the head first and then the rest.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, after you have placed your animal on your clay
<lb />cake, you are distracted with other occupations, rub your
<lb />animal with eau-de-vie, & under the belly, so that it
<lb />does not dry & attach itself to the earth.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, when you pierce your animal, it renders water from the bottom
<lb />of the side of the belly on the slab of earth, clean it well
<lb />with cotton for the sand that 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Eau-de-vie in three goes.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />would touch it would be lumpy. If
<lb />it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and touch it
<lb />& moisten well with eau-de-vie.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tempering the sand and molding the first cast
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a bowl of leaded earth of such size that
<lb />it can hold the tempered sand which will be needed <-of-> to
<lb />fill your mold in one go, which is <-mei->
<lb />better than in two goes, because if you do not cast the second wet batch
<lb /> promptly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the
<lb />first one will set & become solid,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f225" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />such that, while reheating, the two casts will unjoin. <-And
<lb />for pl-> Therefore, for this effect, take several bowls of
<lb />different size which have a lip, to cast better. In these, pour
<lb />some common fountain water, & mix into it as
<lb />much sal ammoniac water as can be held in an
<lb />egg, # composed as mentioned.
<lb />If you want to cast in lead or tin, because one would
<lb />need more for casting gold & silver, the
<lb />water being in your bowl, <-mix->
<lb />put <-in it-> your sand in it & not the water
<lb />in the sand, & add it <-a dista dista-> with such
<lb />discretion that, <-il-> while stirring & mixing it
<lb />promptly with a wooden spoon, it does not become thicker
<lb />than <-clear-> mustard. And thus, cast <-the-> first into your mold
<lb />the lighter part, <-which es-> as is always at the surface, with a shaking motion, &
<lb /><-da-> from a little height. And doing so,
<lb />when the animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order
<lb />to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wetted sand makes &
<lb />continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &
<lb />a little thicker than at the top, until everything is filled, up to the
<lb />mark for thickness that you made.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> And do not forget to shake the mold
<lb /><-in order-> while casting, in order that the wetted sand runs
<lb />& enters well everywhere. Also, tip your mold up on the side
<lb />of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your mold
<lb />will have the same thickness, & you will spare sand.
<lb />All of this being carefully done <-fai->, let it set, which will
<lb />take a quarter of an hour. Then, release the
<lb />clay circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
<lb />a little, & separate your mold from the
<lb />cake of earth, which also <-de-> will
<lb />be appropriate for molding right away, and trim the excess with a big
<lb />knife, giving || to it the long shape of a mandore.
<lb /><-Rasche->
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you can, fill your half mold in one go, & with
<lb /><-the pre-> a tempered batch, it is the best.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />#
<lb />or two eggs, because there is no risk if there will be more.
<lb /><-And the water-> If you cast in two goes, it is enough
<lb />to put sal ammoniac water at the first bowlful. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make it clear like a pureed broth, or like starch
<lb />water that women use to make their starch. For
<lb />there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles at
<lb />the bottom & water separates & remains on top. The sand that one 
<lb />scrapes as well [illegible]mme too weak & soft. And it will not let
<lb />itself set quickly, for all things calcined dry out promptly from mixed
<lb />water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you do not fill in one go your mold
<lb /><-tempered-> with tempered sand, take heed to stir your
<lb />second cast with the <-e-> <-p-> surface of the first,
<lb /><-p-> by mixing with your spoon or spatula with which you temper it.

</ab>

<lb /> without changing.

<lb />Sal ammoniac water is not necessary to small

<lb />Second cast
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is the
<lb />back, the backbone, and the entire top part, and the
<lb /><-len-> half-mold where it is enclosed has set
<lb />and is hard enough, 
<lb /> +  uncover the whole bottom part & side of the belly,
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> now with a knife <-& tant->
<lb />at the thickest places, & then with a penknife, where the
<lb />most delicate parts are enclosed, such as the legs, the tail, &
<lb />similar things, and because the head is higher, you will also need to
<lb />look for it & uncover deeper, and make a deeper notch there which
<lb />ought to release easily. That is to say, widening on the outside, in order that
<lb />the second mold that you will cast on it can come out well,
<lb />which even the animal can help with, which is malleable and obedient,
<lb />being natural. However, <-ad-> be more careful
<lb />when uncovering the throat of the lizard than with the
<lb />snake, for the lizard has large jaws & large bones
<lb />that are not malleable and has hollow ears, where, if the wet sand has
<lb />entered, it is not <-aff-> easy to release. But you will
<lb />avoid all of this, if you uncover half of the head and those things that
<lb />you know do not release well. Once everything is uncovered well, blow
<lb />on top & wipe each part, by wiping with tiny hog 
<lb />bristle brushes, slightly moistened by the end with a
<lb />little saliva, or with clear water, as you uncover
<lb />it, in order that <-your-> the uncovered lower part of your
<lb />animal will be very neat. #
<lb />🝋 With this done, dip <-the
<lb />rev-> <-your mold->, for the length
<lb />of a paternoster, your mold in water, not
<lb /><-from the-> the uncovered side but
<lb />opposite & the reverse of the uncovered thing. And this is in order that,
<lb />by sucking the water inside, the oil with which
<lb />you next anoint the other side <-to avoid->, is not
<lb />imbibed at all, but remains on the surface & prevents the second
<lb />cast that you will cast on it from attaching to it. Having therefore
<lb />thus dipped the reverse of your mold in the
<lb />water, take a paintbrush especially dedicated to
<lb />this & <-anoint it-> with it, anoint with oil
<lb />the whole surface of the mold, except the animal, which must in
<lb />no way touch the oil, & take heed to retrace well & to anoint
<lb />with the point of a paintbrush between the parts &
<lb />through all the delicate parts. And if by chance the oil is
<lb />imbibed, dip the <-mo-> reverse of the mold, as
<lb />mentioned, in water, & you will see the oil return to
<lb />the surface in little drops.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mold small animals like big ones, except that you need to make

<lb />

<lb />However, leave the point of the throat, so that it serves as a
<lb />clue to find the head, which is deeper down than any other part, because
<lb />when making the arrangement you disposed it higher. It is also at the

<lb />with this one to uncover, and follow the rest through the trace of the
<lb />points.

<lb />#

<lb />And if some bit of nail from a leg, or from a tail, or from another

<lb />between the two a small grain of wax, & with the point of a

<lb />This thus prepared, place your <-de-> first

<lb /><-not-> evaporates, wet your sand and cast it in thrusts and by blowing & moving the mold as you did
<lb />for the first one, making sure that the <-first q->
<lb />beginning of that which you pour on the animal should be a little lighter than the
<lb />next one so that it moistens everywhere & closely follows the more delicate
<lb />parts. So, leave it for a quarter of an hour to set, then
<lb />remove the circle & the clay cake. And, with a
<lb />knife, arrange your two molds uniformly together in a
<lb />long shape of a mandore, as mentioned, because of the cast.
<lb />Then, dip a little the whole mold evenly, at the level of the
<lb />joints, in water, for this is another secret to unjoin them,
<lb />otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore, by
<lb />this means, and next, extract gently & with patience and method
<lb />the half of the animal remaining in one of the molds,
<lb /><-for-> pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from
<lb />the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
<lb />the mold. <-And-> The latter being empty,
<lb /><-extract-> rejoin the two halves so that no dust
<lb />enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make the
<lb />gate & vents, & place the clamps. As for the animal, so
<lb />that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of
<lb />five times, put it in water. And I think that it would keep even
<lb />better in eau-de-vie. However, the best would be to mold
<lb />in the same day the 4 or 5 molds that you can do,
<lb />because these corrupt animals in themselves stink within one day. Having left your molds one or two
<lb /><-es-> days to dry, for they stay
<lb />humid for a good month, make the vents on one
<lb />half 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+ Note that when you have made your second
<lb />cast, were you to leave your mold for one
<lb />day or a night without opening
<lb />it, you would need to then dip it in hot water or else reheat it
<lb />before opening it, as for crabs.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, after both halves of the noyau have made a strong & hard set, you
<lb />would not dip your mold in water, it would not unjoin at
<lb />all. But as you dip the reverse of the mold in water,
<lb />the imbibed oil collects at the top & at the level of the
<lb />joints & makes it separate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />However, take heed your second mold is of good thickness &
<lb />that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
<lb />dipped it in water, & you want to open it, there is a risk
<lb />that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
<lb />it, dip all of it in water and rub it everywhere,
<lb />where it will harden if it has set well. Then, take your two
<lb />molds, joined with a rough linen cloth in
<lb />order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
<lb />wanted to tear apart a loaf of bread. But if it happens to break, join
<lb />it & on the reverse, strengthen the joints with clamps.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Next, you can repair the faults with small chisels.

<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />to cast by the tail or from the back of the animal,
<lb />make it so that the vents come from

<lb />        If your snake has been without eating for a long time, it
<lb />            happens that, when you want to put it to death in urine &
<lb />            vinegar, it fills with a lot of water & swells, and
<lb />            next it dries out as you fix & arrange it on the clay
<lb />            cake, and next it happens that when you have cast your
<lb />            <-mold-> tempered sand on it, & it has set, it
<lb />            ends up coming out such that between the snake and animal there
<lb />            is a line of distance <-D->, in which enters
<lb />            the second batch of cast tempered sand <-M->. Avoid this,
<lb />            therefore, if you can. But if this cannot be, do not let this prevent
<lb />            your second cast, for the sand which will enter in this void will be so
<lb />            weak that it will easily be removed with a small point &
<lb />            will not have set with the first hardened one.
<lb />        
<lb />        Note that one needs more feather alum for
<lb />            molds that should be reheated, like those for gold
<lb />            & silver & things that one needs to burn inside than for those which release well & that are only for casting
<lb />            lead & tin. However, do not put too much in either one. 
<lb />        
<lb />    
<lb />    
<lb />    
<lb />   
<lb /><-N-> And having done your cast, do not forget to make in
<lb />it some holes and <-[illegible]->notches because the metal will run more neatly thus than if
<lb />the cast were even, for it gets corrupted in its notches & holes,
<lb />& does not go so much at once, & does not become as porous. This
<lb />done, <-put-> join <-t-> the two halves of your mold & strengthen the joints,
<lb />putting around these some small clamps of iron wire of this shape
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />. They
<lb />prevent 
<lb />the molds from deforming & corrupting while reheating.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This is the shape of the clamps
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Animal after release
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, by chance, you gave your snake such a curled shape
<lb />that the place of the belly cannot easily come out, especially
<lb />since the head & the tail, which are the two ends, are
<lb />thinner, cut everything which is outside, & reheat the
<lb />mold so well that what remained inside burns, then pass some
<lb />quicksilver inside, & attracting <-that which->
<lb />the ashes & the burnt bones from the inside, it will
<lb />also come out, because the conduit is big, & thus will not sour at
<lb />all your material. You can pull really strongly the molded
<lb />snake, because it is soft & malleable & obedient, &
<lb />the mold, having set, is so firm that, because of this, the
<lb />imprint will not be spoiled. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Reheating of Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />After your molds have been reheated <-le p->
<lb />& cleaned, casting soonest is best, because if you keep them, they
<lb />get corrupted and moistened. Reheat the thickest part, where the body of the animal is, 
<lb />at the top, so that, if there is something inside to burn, it falls to the bottom.
<lb />Mark
<lb />the part
<lb />on top to
<lb />recognize it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It can only be good to let the mold die down a little from the outside 
<lb /><-so long as->, being well reheated, so long as it remains red on the inside when you will cast.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast of tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the plant or flower that you want to cast <-in tin-> is
<lb />delicate & fine, it is necessary that the tin exceeds the
<lb />lead in the mixture, & on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
<lb />necessary that the lead exceeds. Therefore, for the <-mixture->
<lb />fine thing, put in some fine tin, not at all the quarter
<lb />part of lead. And make sure that your mold is
<lb />hottish, such that you can hold it in your
<lb />hand when you want to cast. As for the
<lb />alloyed tin, the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
<lb />very hot & almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
<lb />having to run the length of the fine branches of
<lb />the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
<lb />mix in it a little looking-glass tin, which makes it run better
<lb />& firms it up.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In the lead alloyed with tin, or tin alloyed with lead,
<lb />you can put a little bit of metalline, & it will seem
<lb />silver. But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
<lb />& sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &
<lb />similar things, it would not be appropriate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For giving venting to the mold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In addition to your vents, if your <-es-> plant is
<lb />very fine, you can pass a thread through the
<lb />clay circle, rather than casting with a
<lb />needle, & make sure it passes through the plant. And with the
<lb />thread burning like the plant, a hole will remain which will
<lb />give air & venting, to help clean.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Reheating the noyau molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />After your molds have their gate, vents &
<lb />clamps, as is said, make at the end of the forge
<lb /><-in->, or in some clean place, a surrounding of
<lb />bricks, and fill it with large half-lit charcoals. And place your
<lb />molds on top, and leave the charcoals thus to kindle by
<lb />themselves for a half hour, so that they heat little
<lb />by little and not all at once. Finally, as they will begin to become white,
<lb />beat <-little by little-> the thus half-lit large charcoals
<lb />on top & blow with your little bellows until they are
<lb />warmed. And thus, little by little, invigorate the fire,
<lb />without haste, until your molds are quite red on the outside
<lb />& the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
<lb />does not release well, & if, for this reason, one needs to burn
<lb />it in the mold, & when you look through the gate, & through it, you see the molds are very red & inflamed
<lb />inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
<lb />you do not see this signal, increase & continue the fire until it is
<lb />the case. If there is nothing in the mold that needs burning,
<lb />it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
<lb />for casting tin. They reheat better in a reverberatory
<lb />furnace.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not pull out
<lb />your reheated molds
<lb />from the fire before they
<lb />have cooled
<lb />themselves, & take care
<lb />that the wind or the
<lb />cold does not hit them while very hot, for this would make them burst.
<lb />One must not reheat them before they
<lb />are dry and firmed up, for they would
<lb />cast in a different way, and
<lb />it is necessary beforehand to make
<lb />gates & vents
<lb />& place clamps.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear <-f->
<lb />that your molds crack inside.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When
<lb />it is black, it is not enough.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For casting in silver, one must not reheat two times
<lb /><-&->, if there is nothing in the mold that needs
<lb /><-releasing-> burning, simply because it does not
<lb />release well. All the molds of flowers are reheated
<lb />two times, first for

<lb /> One needs to mold them as soon as they are picked because they
<lb /><-ont-> wilt & dry out. Dip them, therefore,
<lb />immediately in good eau-de-vie & then put them in your
<lb />tempered sand mold, like snakes. For which one needs no
<lb />release, for while the molds are being 
<lb />reheated <-s-> [<-s->], the plant burns, which does not happen with
<lb />animals that have bones <-& q->. It is necessary
<lb />that for bouquets, the sand be not as thick as for snakes
<lb />because, if it were thick, it would crush the flower.

<lb />burning the plants, flowers, and animal parts which are left inside. Next, one
<lb />needs to clean them & remove the ashes. Second, reheat them
<lb />& render them red for casting. At the beginning, reheat with some
<lb />charcoals, gently lit, and put your noyau molds flat
<lb />on the charcoals surrounded by bricks. Frame molds are
<lb />reheated on a grate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molding <-with-> en noyau, with the same
<lb />sand, wax images, or lead medals and suchlike
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Check if they release well. If they do not, fill with wax
<lb />what does not, and then anoint your images of wax or of
<lb />lead with olive oil, very thinly & very
<lb />lightly, such that the oil makes no thickness nor body on the
<lb />medal. Then, heat a little eau-de-vie,
<lb /><-until-> & when it is lukewarm, moisten the oiled
<lb />medal with it, for if <-it is-> the water were cold, it
<lb />would reject the oil, it would not sit well on it. Next, cast your sand
<lb />of plaster, <-bri-> brick, &
<lb />wet alum on top, having arranged your image on the clay
<lb />mandore & having made a circle around it
<lb /><-de-> to give it the necessary thickness. These medals
<lb />are oiled and rubbed thus with eau-de-vie
<lb />because they are firm & hard & would not be malleable for taking
<lb />out of the<-e-> <-the-> mold, which is
<lb />tenacious, as are natural animals, which are soft &
<lb />flexible.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have tempered your sand, do not cast it in the middle of the
<lb />mold but on the sides, so that the sand descends gently and
<lb />that the beginning is thin & afterward thick. If your tempered sand
<lb />sounds like water falling in the mold, it is a sign that
<lb />is too thin. Make it, therefore, of medium thickness.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Casting for gold and silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that the molds be fiery red & ablaze when
<lb />you cast in gold & silver, or you burn flowers and
<lb />bouquets. The gate should not be very thick at the entryway of the
<lb />molded thing because the substance flows better when at ease and
<lb />without shaking the mold, & does not become as porous.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />After you have cast or beaten in gold the thin leaves of a
<lb />rose or other things, if you want to enamel them, you
<lb />need to solder or braze your delicate gold leaves onto
<lb />silver strips, which <-uy-> will strengthen them
<lb />to support the enamel. Next, once the thing has been
<lb />enameled, put the work in aquafortis <-d->, which will eat away the
<lb />silver & leave all the gold with its enamel.
<lb />For this, the gold needs to be passed with ciment real.

<lb />Molding snakes in all weather

<ab>
<lb /><-Aulcu-> Because in the winter they hide
<lb />in the earth, some feed them <-des-> in quantity in
<lb />barrels filled with earth & covered with
<lb />manure. Others make several molds in
<lb />summer, because with one snake, you can make four or
<lb />five. And others mold lengthwise a natural snake,  without
<lb />it being curled, with common plaster, reheated as said
<lb /><-pu->, en noyau & in two half
<lb />molds, as said, then they cast it in wax. In that way
<lb />they have snakes that they can twist as they like, and then
<lb />they cast them in metal, as is said.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, in twisting the snake from wax, some feature becomes
<lb />undone, you can repair it by removing the protrusions from the molded
<lb />wax.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mixture of tin and lead
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For delicate plants & other flowers or thin foliage, the fine
<lb />tin ought to exceed the lead more than three parts.
<lb />And if it is a thick & coarse material, the lead ought to
<lb />exceed by more than three parts. Heat the mostly tin
<lb />mixture until it is almost red & very hot. And when you want to
<lb />cast, in removing your crucible from the fire, throw in two or
<lb />three grains of rosin, & for one lb & a half
<lb />or two of lead or tin, put with the rosin as
<lb />much looking-glass tin as the size of a hazelnut
<lb />with its shell, & mix & cast. And make sure that there is
<lb />more of the metal than is needed, in order that some is left.
<lb />However, if there is not enough, finish casting, & it will take. But
<lb />it will not be so neat. Next, dip your mold into water,
<lb />& with a point, release it carefully so that nothing is
<lb />spoiled. Make your cast a bit longer. If the material is very
<lb />thin, one needs for it to be almost all tin.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you <-mold de plu-> want to cast <-in-> lead or
<lb />tin en noyau in the aforesaid sand, reheat your
<lb />mold once, only if there is nothing to burn inside. But if it
<lb />is for plants, flowers, & animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it
<lb />two times, however not as much the second time for lead &
<lb />tin as for silver & gold. For for these, they
<lb />ought to be red when you cast, but for lead and tin, let
<lb />it cool until you can hold the tip of your
<lb />finger in the gate without burning yourself,
<lb />but you find a lukewarm heat. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast for copper and latten
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For red copper, one needs to put sal ammoniac, which
<lb />cleans & purges it of all its crust when it is well melted. There
<lb />are some who put in pieces of <-old leather-> thick new
<lb />leather. Others, parings of the feet of field mice.
<lb />Others, melted common salt alone, or melted with saltpeter.
<lb />The principal is sal ammoniac & a little fine tin, as
<lb />to what you want to cast. Red copper is more troublesome to melt
<lb /><-M-> than latten. But when it is well melted, it runs
<lb />better, especially if it is alloyed <-with a-> with latten.
<lb />Latten alloys with a quarter of copper, and
<lb />one puts it in like in copper. But
<lb />particularly, a little calamine makes it run well.

<lb />A means of molding flowers and plants
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to choose them in their full verdure & vivacity, &
<lb /><-them mou-> not pick them, if possible, until the time
<lb />one will want to mold them, so that they do not wilt. Or, if you need to
<lb />carry them from afar, soak their stems in a bottle of
<lb />water or, better still, wine. Make, first, a
<lb />wax stick pointed like a large peg, of a size appropriate to what
<lb />you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. Put & prick at
<lb />the foot of this small peg a bit of rather thickish &
<lb />strong iron wire. And at the point of this, you will fit your flower stem or your
<lb />plant. This done, set it aside neatly. And arrange your
<lb /><-mold of t-> circle & shape of clay, as you
<lb />have done for the snakes, in the form of a mandore
<lb /><-in such a way that-> according to the size of your plant. Then,
<lb />take the one that you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you,
<lb />& wet & moisten it very carefully with good
<lb />eau-de-vie with a paintbrush. Then pass the
<lb />iron stem through the end of the earthen
<lb />mandore, in order that the wax <-q->
<lb />peg, where the plant is fastened, joins to the end of the earthen
<lb />mandore. And arrange thus your plant in such a way lying down
<lb />that it remains in the middle of the said mandore, without
<lb />touching on either side, so that <-a-> the sand that you will
<lb />pour in it will be of equal thickness <-as-> everywhere &
<lb />exceed [<-is->] everywhere by the height of two good
<lb />fingers the top of the <-such-> plant. And
<lb />having secured the iron stem well, promptly pour <-wetted->
<lb />your wetted sand, much thinner than the one for snakes, in the
<lb />mandore. And the sooner the better, in order that the
<lb />eau-de-vie does not dry. And take heed to put in a little more
<lb />sal ammoniac water among the
<lb />common than you would do for the
<lb />snakes. And when you will make sand especially for your
<lb />bouquets, where you would mix in a little more feather alum, it
<lb />can only be better. Thus, your mold will be in one piece
<lb />and it will not be necessary to unjoin it, but rather <-leave->
<lb />separate it from the clay once it will have set, let it dry, and
<lb />then reheat it again until the plants are burnt.
<lb /><-Then-> And note that if the plant you want to cast has
<lb />a strong stalk & stem, you can cast it lying down, as had been said.
<lb />But if it is some weak & delicate flower, <-cast->
<lb />plant it upright with the wax peg because the sand will
<lb />always <-cast-> lift it up, it being very thin. Do not forget to
<lb />adapt two vent holes with two small sticks, starting at the
<lb />foot of the cast, which is the pointed end of the wax
<lb />peg.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the plants are so delicate that they rise to the top when you pour

<lb />For removing flashing and barbs from things molded à noyau
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your molds are of good plaster which withstands
<lb />well the fire, <-&-> they will not crack at all, especially
<lb />if, with presses, they are squeezed well between two
<lb />boards or in a vessel filled with ashes or
<lb />sand, & in this way they will make no flashing. But if they do
<lb />make some, you can remove it with a burin that one calls
<lb />chaple, which has a tip like a small
<lb />chisel.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For grottos
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The old vine stocks
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Stones made from water called stuf,
<lb />charcoal, the compound of tin & fine latten, paper
<lb />pestled & mixed with pestled glass, cork,
<lb />heated parchment, white coral are appropriate for making grottos. But fantastical pieces of wood which are
<lb />found in the forests, & mushrooms, and
<lb />potirons of trees, once dry, are better than
<lb />any other because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of
<lb />looking-glass tin, which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles diverse sorts of marcasites which one washes to cleanse them of
<lb />earth, & one sprinkles the work with it, which is very
<lb />beautiful. If there is no fountain in the grotto, one
<lb />glues all <-al-> of this with strong glue, 
<lb /><-which-> and it is soon done. Take
<lb />specimens of all kinds of minerals. The sulfurous marcasites,
<lb />which do not have a grain but are uniform like looking-glass tin,
<lb />are very beautiful.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Rosette is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle
<lb />lumps which are pulverized under the hammer, which are very
<lb />beautiful pulverized on grottos.

<ab>
<lb />Casting in frames
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The same sand that was used in the cooked noyaulx,
<lb />composed, as is said, of plaster, brick & feather alum, is excellent for casting in frames, and I
<lb />have experienced it thus: I pestled the pieces which had come out of
<lb />noyau molds in a mortar, dragging the
<lb />pestle because this sand is very soft. I did not
<lb />pass it through the sieve because the feather alum mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass, but I
<lb />ground finely upon marble what seemed to me too coarse.
<lb />And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with sal ammoniac
<lb />water, made of sal ammoniac, as much as two
<lb />walnuts, in a bottle of common water, the
<lb />same size as a bottle in which one boils tisane, or in a
<lb />good pot of water, so that you find <-d->
<lb />the water moderately salty. I mixed throughout <-water
<lb />of-> half a glass  of sal ammoniac, <-two
<lb />ault-> two <-au t-> silver
<lb />spoonfuls of eau-de-vie.
<lb /><-J’a-> Having thus moistened the sand in such a fashion
<lb />that it gives a good hold, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my
<lb />medal with charcoal pulverized with a file, to rid it of
<lb />oil and all other grease, which are necessary to avoid,
<lb />for they would <-make-> hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
<lb />& molded it, and the female part of the frame once
<lb />filled, I marked & made a line on the reverse <-of
<lb />the-> & edge of the medal & on the nearby sand as well. In
<lb />order that the second frame <-s’em-> take the
<lb />imprint thereupon to denote the place for making the cast, <-having
<lb />filled-> <-the female part of the frame being filled-> I
<lb />uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with
<lb />pulverized charcoal, and then filled the male part with sand.
<lb /><-Once fai-> I separated the frame and did not hit the
<lb />corners of the <-d-> medal to make it release, because
<lb />that knocks the sand & makes it <-esp-> crumble.
<lb />Rather, I struck the back of the frame, retaining the obverse of
<lb />the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not
<lb />released thus, I would have waited to remove it until the
<lb />frames had been dried out over fire. I lit <-the-> a row
<lb />of charcoals between two little trivets of iron in the
<lb />form that you see, and put the back <-the-> & reverse of the
<lb />frames thereupon & the imprint on top, because in this
<lb />way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, from
<lb />being too moistened they should crack, it is on the back, which <-pr->
<lb />takes the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe &
<lb />whole.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For better, one needs to reheat the sand used for the noyau
<lb />before using it in frame, until it no longer
<lb />contracts.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Excellent sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, to cover
<lb />the medal with. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For medals & flat things, the true heat of lead &
<lb />tin is when it is melted gently.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Note that I filled the frame before pressing it and did not
<lb />hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
<lb />hands, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure
<lb />your frame that it does not shift at all, & if you put some
<lb />wetted sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make the gate so that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
<lb />medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
<lb />not forget the vents.

<ab>
<lb />To dry frames is to rid them of humidity so that they no
<lb />longer smoke, being nevertheless very hot.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Reheating is to redden the frame, which is done for
<lb />gold and for silver.

<pb facs="#f236" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> As I saw that they did not smoke anymore & that, scratching
<lb />the back & the front of the cast & having found that they are
<lb />rough & firm & hard on one side and the other, which is a good
<lb />sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some fine
<lb />tin <-f->, one lb, & one ounce
<lb />of lead, fine & new. I melted it in a crucible until
<lb />it was, <-a little-> as it were, a little red. Being in this way quite hot
<lb /><-I smoked & not p-> & being ready to cast, & not
<lb />before, I smoked with the smoke of a tallow candle all
<lb />sides of my frames & imprint & cast & everything.
<lb />I set my frame, well joined, in the press. I drew my
<lb />crucible from the fire. I left it a little so that
<lb />the redness at the bottom of the crucible could <-pass-> die
<lb />down. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
<lb />grains of something like pitch rosin, & at the same time the
<lb />size of a bean of looking-glass tin, & I
<lb />mixed, & stirred the crucible a little, and I cast. And the
<lb />medal came out as neat as the principal. I smoked it with the
<lb />candle & cleaned it with small
<lb />brushes.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
<lb />lower, will come out better & make the cast longish. And when you
<lb />cast several medals in a large frame, they will come out
<lb />better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Advice about the above
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Good tin is that which is hard as silver
<lb />& soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
<lb />tin & alloyed as is said.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Looking-glass tin must not be <-smoked-> mixed until
<lb />the instant that you want to cast.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Nor must the forms be smoked until then.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> If the sand shrinks in the frame, this means that it must
<lb />be reheated & reddened on the fire.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Good sand, when moistened, does not stick at all to the
<lb />hand when pressed.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The perfect sand for the frame is
<lb />aspalt, which is found in
<lb />Germany, which is soft as flour <-& presq->
<lb />when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Nota that the cast must be thin & hardly thick
<lb />in order that it does not overtax the material, and must not
<lb />exceed the thickness of <-un-> the width of a grain of
<lb />wheat; likewise for tin, which wants to be cast
<lb />very thinly. For lead, a little thicker. There is no need to make
<lb />the vents very large & deep either.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For frames, the sand that you use for the noyau, of the
<lb />aforesaid composition, is excellent. But in washing, crushing &
<lb />reheating it several times, it must be corrupt from its nature & no longer fit to make a hold & to mold en noyau.

<ab>
<lb />Fashion of preparing <-a spalt->
<lb />spat
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is found in earth in Germany, the color of cooked
<lb />plaster, made of long filaments, very soft to handle. And because it
<lb />is mixed with earth and filth, one pestles it coarsely
<lb />& one makes little balls, having for this purpose soaked it in
<lb />sal ammoniac water of such a composition that you were told
<lb />above. One places these balls to reheat in the fire of the fornaise
<lb />of the potters, then one soaks it again in the same
<lb />water. The earth and the coarseness and
<lb />filth go to the bottom, and the pure aspalte,
<lb />which is light & soft, and handleable as wet flour, adheres
<lb />with the water and goes to the surface, clouding the
<lb />water, which murkiness is emptied into a separate vase.
<lb />When it has settled, one empties the water by tilting or by taking
<lb />it away with a sponge, and the pure aspalte
<lb />remains at the bottom. Dry it & employ it in a frame that has
<lb />been moistened with sal ammoniac water. And try it in the
<lb />frame, in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is to
<lb />say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and redden it.
<lb />Thus, for medals and flat things, you should use this one, because it is
<lb />the most perfect of all for gold, silver, copper,
<lb />lead, latten, & tin, for it withstands the fire
<lb />& reddens whenever need be, without corrupting. The more it is used,
<lb />the <-b-> better it is, & it does not spoil. At the beginning
<lb />it is white, & being used, it becomes grey. However, make sure to put
<lb />aside the one that served for casting lead & tin &
<lb />latten, for gold would sour in it, & would not come
<lb />out of it well. And to do this better, you could put it aside to be used
<lb />for each metal. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />See Gesnerus, De lapidibus
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It endures ten or twelve castings without corrupting, it withstands the
<lb />fire & reddens, it is suitable for all metals. It is so
<lb />tenacious that should the frame be furrowed, it holds.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The spat almost does not set, even though it is reheated & is
<lb />a kind of plaster. Raw, it breaks easily with the
<lb />fingers.

<lb />Excellent secret for molding hollow and very delicately in fine
<lb />gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast with your aforesaid sand your animal and lizard
<lb />or other thing with billon silver, & it will come out very
<lb />neat. <-E-> But take heed to mold it hollow, or at least leave a
<lb />small hole in its mouth<-[illegible]-> or in another place. Next,
<lb />gild it with fine gold, as uniform as it will be possible
<lb />for you, three or four or five times, & until your gold has
<lb />the thickness of a piece of paper or something similar,
<lb />& all the scales will always show equally. Next, put it in good
<lb />aquafortis, which, by this hole, will corrode the billon,
<lb />& the gold will remain hollow & light &
<lb />wonderful.

<lb />Sand for casting in gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />You could cast gold well in common sand of
<lb />goldsmiths, should you throw therein
<lb />some substance that makes it run.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take common sand of alum, of plaster &
<lb />brick, according to the composition said above. Add to it some
<lb />more feather alum. And mix in not quite the third
<lb />part of crocum ferri. However, its quantity cannot
<lb />be harmful, for it is that which receives the gold & thanks
<lb />to which it comes out very neatly. But it were good that your
<lb />crocum had previously been in the
<lb />glassmaker’s fornaise, <-4-> three <-or 4->
<lb />days [<-and->] <-three days-> and three
<lb />nights, in a flat box where it should not be very thick, so that it reheats better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Before the invention of crocum, one
<lb />would cast flowers in silver but not at all in gold. It has not been
<lb />forty years that one
<lb />knows this in Germany.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sublimate is commonly employed by goldsmiths for
<lb />gold. Some add sulfur, but they & others are wrong,
<lb />for sulfur sours, even as it heats. And the sublimate is
<lb />agitated, boils, and bubbles. It is very good to clean gold
<lb />because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
<lb />smoke. But to warm gold & conserve its heat, there is only
<lb />the couleur, which is verdet, sal ammoniac,
<lb />saltpeter & borax. This makes it run, & you can
<lb />throw in a branch of wormseed.

<lb />One needs for the cage, made like those for larks
<lb />like a barn & lined with green fabric, to be
<lb />made with a drawer underneath, to refresh its fresh earth
<lb />everyday, for it takes much delight in this, & mix in it
<lb />some ants. You can carry an anthill with its earth
<lb />in a barrel full of earth, & keep them there & they
<lb />will lay their eggs there, in order to always have some at hand when you
<lb />want them, should you take pleasure in feeding nightingales.
<lb />When you have taken it, it is fat & full, & thus, to keep it in
<lb />its strength, one needs to, for the first day,
<lb />take <-uy-> it in the
<lb />hand & open its beak & put in its beak with a
<lb />small pointed stick some mutton heart or other
<lb />delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, in order to fill its

<lb />has gotten over its fancy. <-The next day you will give

<lb />day & will also make it drink. The next
<lb />morning, you will give it in its cage some well-minced
<lb />flesh with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and change it two or three
<lb />times a day, for it will not eat it if it is
<lb />hardened & if it is not fresh. And if it goes half a
<lb />day without eating, one needs to feed it as before &
<lb />do so until it

<lb /> antimony, sublimate, finely pulverized.
<lb /><-This-> From this gets made a mass that does not sour. If the <-s-> plaster is good, one ought
<lb />not to add crocum for silver, but one puts more

<lb />Keeping dry flowers in the same

<ab>
<lb /> state all year
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This is a rare secret, & which gives pleasure for adorning
<lb />tables, rooms & cabinets out of season,
<lb />when winter denies flowers. Take heed, therefore, to
<lb /><-ce-> pick them when they are in full vigor &
<lb />growing. For if you were to take them when their season
<lb />is past or when they are starting to wilt, they would not keep.
<lb />Having thus chosen them, therefore, take sand, the leanest &
<lb />driest you can find, which should be very fine, like that which
<lb />goldsmiths <-use-> use to work
<lb />enamel or like that for stampings. But above all, it must not
<lb />make dust, nor remain on the hand, or leave a mark on it
<lb />when you have pulverized it & then poured it. For it is
</ab>

<lb />        
<lb />River sand washed by the current of the

<lb />Flowers are also kept in their same beauty in distilled vinegar
<lb /><-v->in a well sealed vessel which does not
<lb />allow any wind, which should be well sealed with wax &
<lb />mastic. Carnations & roses, the residue
<lb />of common vinegar makes them rot. If the sand makes
<lb />dust, & clings to the flowers, & is not easily removed
<lb />with a paintbrush, it is no good. The leanest is the
<lb />best.

<lb />Make sure your box is well joined, in order that the sand
<lb />does not trickle out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and
<lb />remove it from the serain & the moisture of the
<lb />night, & cover it & keep it in a dry
<lb />place.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-That-> Take heed not to put the said flowers in big
<lb />vessels, for when one pulls out one, one needs to pull out all. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take good heed not to pick your flowers <-q-> in rainy and
<lb />humid weather, but when the sun has been shining on
<lb />them.

<pb facs="#f240" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />a sign that it has some humidity, & if the flower also had some
<lb />aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be <-too-> coarse,
<lb />for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower & make it lose
<lb />its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a box, in
<lb />which you first make a mound of the said sand, on which you will set the
<lb />stalk of your flower, <-in such a way-> laid down so that the flower
<lb />touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the box, but
<lb />remains in the air. Then, weigh down the stalk with more <-on->
<lb />sand in order that it remains firm & fixed. Finally, take some of the
<lb />same sand & with two fingers pulverize & cast
<lb />it delicately on the flower, <-e-> imitating in that the flow of
<lb />an hourglass. And when the flower is as if
<lb /><-half-> covered, strike your fist on the table
<lb />where the box is set in order that the sand drops & enters
<lb />everywhere. Finally, cover it all over and thus lay in other flowers,
<lb />in order, one over the other, as many as your box can contain.
<lb />That being thus arranged, expose it for several
<lb />days to hot sun. And while the flower dries, the
<lb />sand, which ever accompanies it & holds it, does not allow that in
<lb />contracting, it shrivels & closes in on itself, but it must dry in the same state as when you put it there. Now
<lb />take heed that you choose for that effect cornflowers,
<lb />marigolds, the yellow meadow flowers called
<lb />ranunculus or pa[<-l->]ta
<lb />lupina, amaranth & suchlike, and broom,
<lb />and others that your experience will teach you.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The sand with which goldsmiths buff enamels or the
<lb />white one that glassmakers use, & any lean sand that does
<lb />not hold together, pass it through a horsehair sieve, for
<lb />it ought not to be so thin. Next, dry it well in the sun for
<lb />several days to remove all humidity from it, and
<lb />ventilate it like grain so that the dust goes away. Once it is
<lb />rid of that dust & well dried, use it as you know.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Pansies are kept thus.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For keeping fruits all year
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to pick them in serain &
<lb /><-s-> quite dry weather & by the stem without
<lb />touching <-it-> the fruit with your hand, and
<lb />put them in glass bottles that have a wide
<lb />opening, like tall glass boxes for putting preserves.
<lb />Fortify them with straw or something else so that they may not
<lb />break, and seal them well with wax so that they may not breathe.
<lb />And if they had a glass lid, well-sealed with wax, they
<lb />would be all the better. Put them in a case in your
<lb />well, or in your cellar in a vat, or in a
<lb />cos of earth full of water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For where the hand will touch, it will rot,

<lb />For casting in silver

<ab>
<lb />You need to arrange your animals as said and compose the same sand
<lb /><-two parts d-> out of 4 parts of
<lb />plaster, of two parts reheated brick, & one
<lb />part reheated feather alum, and mix
<lb />it well. Then, having been prepared thus, and you wishing to mold it,
<lb />take the three parts of an earthenware bowl, from which
<lb />the peasants eat their soup, of the aforesaid
<lb />sand, & add to it pure feather alum,
<lb />reheated & pulverized in the mortar, as much as you
<lb />can take with 4 fingers and the thumb, or a
<lb />small double handful. Then, mix [<-mix->] well & wet
<lb />with a little sal ammoniac & the rest of the common
<lb />water, + & stir it with your spatula so
<lb />that it all becomes like a thick sauce or thin
<lb />mustard, & having rubbed the animal with eau-de-vie with the

<lb />Silver for casting
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is not fine silver but alloyed, & which does not
<lb />become perfectly white on the fire because they put it to whiten after the
<lb />fusion to also clean it of the solder <-or of this->. When
<lb />you need to attach some <-leg-> animal against another or to
<lb />repair, it is commonly teston silver. And all
<lb />alloyed silver, as long as it is sweet, is good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Before starting to cast in silver, one needs to
<lb />have earth <-of which-> which withstands the fire, like
<lb />the sandy earth <-of qu-> mixed with cloth
<lb />waste which founders use to cast their cannons, or any
<lb />good lute which withstands the fire, in order to surround your
<lb />molds & fortify them, for they must be all red. One
<lb />needs to also bind them with iron wire.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />That before <-casting l'ar-> reheating the molds, you
<lb />have the mixture one needs to make the silver run.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the goldsmiths knew [<-knew->] the substance to make
<lb />silver run in their works, they would buy much of it. Some buy it five
<lb />sous for a denier.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I have used silver from the Capital
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Before <-binding-> luting & strengthening your molds
<lb />for gold & silver with the aforesaid earth, one
<lb />needs for the cast to be made & the vents, & the molds
<lb />to have been reheated <-of-> very red to burn the animals,
<lb />flowers, and plants that are inside, & to clean them well of the
<lb />ashes. Once quite clean & prepared, lute them & bind them
<lb />with iron wire, & reheat them again until they will
<lb />be quite red.

<lb />Arranging various animals

<lb />When you uncover some female lizards entwined while biting each
<lb />other, <-&-> which is the most difficult thing to mold
<lb />because of the number of feet & because of the tip of their tails,
<lb />which are very fine, <-One-> take heed that if some part should
<lb /><-trou-> be uncovered that remains as if
<lb />suspended in mid air to steady it, in order that the second cast, which
<lb />you will do on top for the second half, will not vary. And to steady it
<lb />over the void, take a little wax & rub it, 
<lb />& lengthen it on a table into the form of a thick needle, 
<lb />then cut that which you will need, & with the tip of a hot iron wire, 
<lb />join it where it will be necessary. Steady also on the <-frame-> mold all that will
<lb />have detached from it (when you uncover the half of the belly) with
<lb />some wax, taken lightly with the point of a penknife,
<lb />& joined & melted with the iron wire. And when
<lb />you make your gate, you ought only to bring the wax to the place &
<lb />to the edge of the wax which, being joined to the animal &
<lb />melting, will continue the gate up to the animal without spoiling
<lb />anything, which is a secret.

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to put in the mouth of the snake some flower
<lb /><-q-> or some branch of a plant which contains the
<lb />antidote against its bite, take a little branch, as best
<lb />arranged as you can find, & pose its stem into its mouth. Then put
<lb />two little pieces of wax around the stem of the plant. And with
<lb />the end of a <-iron-> wire that is hot, melt the
<lb />wax a little, & with the other hand, close
<lb />the jaws of the animal. And then you can cut the head to make it burn
<lb />with the flower. If the plant <-s-> is strong enough, it
<lb />will hold up by itself, and should it be weak like wormwood
<lb />leaf, which droops, the humidity of the sand will lift it up, & make
<lb />it swim & hold up without putting anything there, although you could
<lb />pass underneath it some thread, going through with a

<lb />Cleaning the bowl and the spoon with which one

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Be careful to clean, as soon as & quickly after you have cast,
<lb />your bowl & your spatula or spoon with
<lb />which you temper your sand, because <-il-> if it dries in
<lb />them, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or
<lb />a fault in the work. Also, when the mold is reheated, these
<lb />little pieces crust up & flake off & prevent neat
<lb />casting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molding hollow
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Wax on its own cools too quickly & does not run well
<lb />everywhere, & tallow keeps its heat well & runs
<lb />everywhere, but on its own it is not good. But when wax &
<lb />tallow are mixed, the work is all the better. Crayfish &
<lb />other small animals can easily be molded hollow for the body, but as for
<lb />the legs, it will be awkward.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The first part of the mold, that is, the first cast on the
<lb />clay slab, cracks more readily in the fire than the
<lb />second.

<lb />Molding medals and flat things
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You do not have to make the gate with legs thus
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />, but rather in this way
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />, which embraces the medal well. For the other way, with legs, is only
<lb />done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is
<lb />wide and in one piece, works better for flat medals. But take heed
<lb />that all gates be very thin close to the medal & almost not as thick
<lb />as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from
<lb />the medal toward the gate, thicken it as it goes, for it comes out better
<lb />thus. If the gate is thick at the entry to the medal, the work will
<lb />never come out well. Make sure that <-desp-> it is moderately 
<lb />thick from the half of the gate at the top, & from the same
<lb />half at the bottom very thin. Do not forget to make grooves
<lb /><-at the hau-> in the top of the gate to prevent that the
<lb />metal runs furiously.

<lb />Your lute being dry, put, in the early
<lb />morning, your crucible in a four à

<lb />reheating your crucible as for gently letting the fury of the
<lb />saltpeter pass. Then, invigorate little by little & with
<lb />judgment the fire. And <-there-> leave in the full vigor of the fire your
<lb />substances for xii hours or a natural
<lb />day. Make each time a good quantity of this substance, so as not to
<lb />do it often, because the fumes, which are dangerous, could
<lb />hurt you. And before working at it, take in the
<lb />morning good buttered toast, and hold the
<lb />said butter, or zedoary, or gold coins, in
<lb />your mouth, and <-ada-> cover your
<lb />face with a cloth from the eyes down. From
<lb />this mass, the crust will serve you <-make run-> to
<lb />clear <-the great works d-> the silver from
<lb />the metallic mass <-like snakes & similar
<lb />things-> when it starts to melt. <-But-> And
<lb />then the grain that will be at the bottom of the
<lb />crucible should be put aside for <-principally delicate
<lb />flowers and herbs-> putting a little in the melted
<lb />silver when you want to cast it <-However it is necessary
<lb />to always put a little of this grain in the silver when <-you
<lb />want to cast-> it is well melted and when you are ready to
<lb />cast->. Thus, do as you make fine tin on copper,
<lb />& for looking-glass tin on lead and on tin.
<lb />And just as looking-glass tin sours lead and tin
<lb />too much if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
<lb />composed of the aforesaid substances would sour your silver
<lb />if <-l-> you were to put in too much and obscure it.
<lb />This aforesaid composition will suffice you for a long time, when
<lb />it has been for a whole day on a <-gentle->
<lb />gentle fire at the beginning & invigorated degree by degree until
<lb />the end. Then, having given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it
<lb />by itself, & let your crucible cool. Next, break it. You
<lb />will find two hard slabs & cakes in the
<lb />crucible. The upper one is as if petrified <-Once->,
<lb />composed of salts, sublimated & mixed together. The lower one
<lb />is metallic, composed of filings, æs
<lb />ustum & antimony, having the grain very small.
<lb />Pulverize the upper cake, made from salts, &

<lb />Animals with hair and fragile and very thin flowers

<ab>
<lb />Animals with hair are awkward to mold because the hair is raised
<lb />& is represented as though mixed up & <-to-> clumped
<lb />together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative
<lb />& that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is
<lb />wheat oil, with which you will anoint it. Once cast, you
<lb />will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies and
<lb />plants that have a stem & leaves which are wooly with a certain
<lb />capricious & downy hair, also need to be anointed with the same
<lb />oil, to keep this down flat; likewise flowers that have
<lb />very delicate & thin leaves, for dry wheat oil makes
<lb />them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
<lb />presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called

<lb />Animals of gold & silver can readily be molded

<lb />There is a property of gold which, even though it is very fine

<lb />Fine gold is opposed to it, for <-[illegible]-> on it, it

<lb />Gold <-f-> <-is not put back on the fire->, with its

<lb />Casting in gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds are reheated better & more surely in a closed
<lb />fire, such as <-pot-> in a reverberatory
<lb />furnace. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some
<lb />important piece <-of gold e-> that has cost a lot to model in
<lb />wax, they put the molds in a pot & cover
<lb />them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire
<lb />that holds them together & tight. Then, they reheat the
<lb />mold, earth & pot together, and when
<lb />everything is quite red, they cast the gold. Fine gold does
<lb />not run well, but alloyed gold does.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Gold & silver do not sour,
<lb />being entirely red and hot, quenched
<lb />in water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Gold is a quarter heavier than lead.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When gold reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an
<lb />emerald.

<lb />Take care that in the place where you want to cast the gold, no
<lb />lead, tin, or lime of these has fallen in the
<lb />forge.

<lb />A means to make the gate for small female lizards
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and because it is
<lb /><-u->so delicate and thin that the <-gate would struggle->
<lb />metal would run with difficulty, especially when it is curled,
<lb />roll wax in little threads of this thickness
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />and apply some with the hot iron wire, as is said, one at
<lb />the end of the tail & the others, that are applied in the same way,
<lb />from one <-edge-> side of the tail to the other, as
<lb />you see depicted. But take heed to make sure that with the end of
<lb />the hot iron wire, the end of the wax barely touches
<lb />the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part.
<lb />But make sure that the end of the wax arranges itself only at the
<lb />edge of the empty part of the first mold. Make also conduits of
<lb />wax around the legs & around the contours of the body which
<lb />are a little long, & they will serve as feeders for the
<lb />molded thing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Follow here
<lb />above 🝋
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate, comes out
<lb />well, the rest will also come out well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The principal thing is that the ears of the snake come out
<lb />well-molded.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal & of the
<lb />thickness of a knife.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f248" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />🝋 From small rolls, you make your gates and vents without danger of
<lb />crusting & removing
<lb />anything from the mold, because the
<lb />wax, being taken away, leaves the empty space all made. Make
<lb />your vents
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />coming from the head, which is in the bottom, toward the
<lb />gate. Make also your gate so that it is <-too-> but a
<lb />little thick, and make within its course two or three notches, for
<lb />this breaks up the fury of the metal
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />& from these conduits & feeders, you can also
<lb />put in small threads of wax which are joined to the body, in
<lb />order that the metal goes more easily from one part to another
<lb />& promptly runs everywhere. And from these conduits, you lead your
<lb />gate & your vents without spoiling anything.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />and makes it flow with ease,
<lb />without bubbling nor making excessive fumes, which hinders its run.
<lb />You can divide it also in two or three branches thus
<lb />        
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />when it approaches the molded thing, and always make holes in the
<lb />gate.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you <-v-> mold something to cast wax in it, you
<lb />mold in plaster alone, reheated after being pulverized.
<lb />For, once reheated in stone, the outside is cooked & the
<lb />inside stays almost raw. Transparent grey plaster is not strong, but the one
<lb />that, being tempered, is white & sets very
<lb />quickly, is good. However, the grey I have found to be quite firm & hard
<lb />after having set, but its takes longer to do so. One needs to know the
<lb />nature of each. <-If you-> You will never mold very neatly if
<lb />[<-not->] you do not temper, very thin &
<lb />liquid, your plaster or your sand of noyau. Temper it
<lb /><-immediately-> quickly after it has been reheated.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
<lb />If you mold with plaster <-crud-> alone, reheat it
<lb />nevertheless as said. One needs to oil well the first
<lb />mold. And when the second one has set well, and it is ready,
<lb />soak it for a long time in water. And if it does not want to
<lb />release, soak it in hot water, for cold water hardens it.

<lb />To know
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The workers from Damascus or from
<lb />Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate, in the
<lb />ore, iron from steel. And, from this
<lb />first steel, first melted from its ore, they
<lb />cast scimitar blades in sand <-sab-> which afterward cut the other iron without any difficulty,
<lb />because any melted iron is harder than soft iron
<lb />beaten from pigs & bars. Thus is the steel of scimitars, but
<lb />it is quite brittle. When one un-hilts <-b-> a scimitar,
<lb />one recognizes by the tang that enters the hilt that it is cast in
<lb />sand.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And hot water softens it further. Cold water does not
<lb />penetrate it like it does with the mixed one, because it is harder &
<lb />the mixed one is more spongy.

<lb />Vipers and snakes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I molded a viper, which, for casting, is more appropriate than
<lb />any other snake because it has scales beautiful & very
<lb />visible on all the body & principally on the head and under the
<lb />throat. It has a flat head, the snout reddish, tending toward
<lb />incarnadine, & snubbed like the horned asp or like
<lb /><-a-> the top of a pig's snout, big jowls, the
<lb />eyes very close to the snout, and the mouth wide open, where it
<lb />has double canine teeth on each side, all coming out of a
<lb />strip of flesh that covers and clothes them. It also has, in the throat,
<lb />a tube of flesh, made like a dog’s penis, from which comes its
<lb />stinger. Other snakes have a double row of teeth.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want <-cut-> <-the-> to mold the snakes

<lb />it will not be released.

<ab>
<lb />Molding turtles
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is a matter different from the casting of snakes, &

<lb />want.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster for casting of wax
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you want to cast in wax in the plaster mold,
<lb />you must know as secret that there is need for your mold to be
<lb />in hot water. Never does the animal come out so neatly as in
<lb />metal, because the wax sticks. But it is to model an
<lb />animal closest to nature <-and-> to repair
<lb />it afterward. One needs to smooth well away all the scales, <-when-> for
<lb />wax would enter there & not release well. In molding thus
<lb />the animal, flatten down the scales for wax &, on
<lb />the contrary, rub them in reverse in order that they stand up for
<lb />animals, for they will only be more visible. Also, do not wait for the
<lb />wax to <-a bit-> cool completely to release it,
<lb />but do so when it is still a bit warm. When you have also molded the
<lb />first cast of the animal, uncover well the half, in order that, in its
<lb />release, there is as much of it in one half of the mold as in the other. Make also strong wide gates, close to the animal, in order that it is fortified

<lb />Molding fruits and animals in sugar
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sugar is fatty when runny and brittle & breakable
<lb />when dry, and with it, one casts well round things & large
<lb />muscles, but awkwardly things fine & delicate. However, try
<lb />well-clarified sugar. One needs to soak for one night
<lb />or one day the plaster mold before
<lb />casting the sugar, in order that it is very full of water
<lb />& does not imbibe the syrup. One needs also for it to be of
<lb />easy release, for the sugar is sour & brittle. Finally, do
<lb />not consider casting anything in sugar that does not release well
<lb />and that cannot be neatly molded in two halves, to open it when you will
<lb />need to. If you want to mold a bunch of grapes, one needs to
<lb />take it, like any other fruit, in its true vigor, for if it is withered,
<lb />it will <-not-> come out that way. Take heed, therefore,
<lb />to make your molds in the natural season of
<lb /><-that-> all things. The grapes that are
<lb />usually wanted cast in sugar can be made artificially or with
<lb />wax or earth, or even with some grapes attached
<lb />with some melted wax on some slab & other full
<lb />thing, so that they are very close together and release well, & only
<lb />make up one half. Or, if you have some of those grapes called
<lb />chauchés or sauvignons, which have the grapes
<lb />very close together, encase half of them <-on-> in the
<lb />clay slab and cast on the other half. And if some 
<lb />grape is not released, pluck it out. Note that neither in
<lb />sugar, nor in metal, can a bunch which has light &
<lb />separated grapes be cast properly, because the end of the bunch
<lb />is so delicate, especially if the grapes are kept, that it could not
<lb />sustain the large grapes. Thus, you will need to cast
<lb />hollow, which you could not do if the bunch does not have the
<lb />grapes close together & <-molds-> without having them
<lb />scattered & spread apart.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To cast pears & apples in sugar, one ought
<lb />not to make any gates, but rather, fill one half of the mold and
<lb />then join the two, and keep turning it until the sugar has set
<lb />and is cold. One ought to mix nothing in the mold apart from
<lb />plaster, reheated as you know.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs for the mold to have soaked one day
<lb />and one night in cold water <-for->, and
<lb />to be humid, when you cast in sugar.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The sign that the syrup or the sugar melted in water is sufficiently
<lb />cooked to cast fruits, is when it makes threads
<lb />    
<lb />    
<lb />when shaking it. And
<lb />if it passes that point, it is not good, for it will always be humid. If
<lb />the sugar sticks, one needs to throw some
<lb />wheat starch in the mold or rub it with an
<lb />almond.

<lb />Crocum ferri
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is much sooner made with iron rust than with
<lb />filings. For if the vinegar is good, you will
<lb />see it boil with large bubbles <-as if it-> on the rust,
<lb />as if it were on the fire; on the filings, it does not boil
<lb />unless it is put on the fire or hot ashes. However, when the
<lb />filings are passed through vinegar, & you have made it
<lb />evaporate & heat up, & it is very red, if you do this again for a
<lb />second time, the vinegar will have much more strength, & the
<lb />crocum will only be finer for it, & redder. Those who
<lb />use it to cast in gold <-ven-> buy the
<lb />ounce for forty or fifty sous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It does not harden the molds, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
<lb />that they are harder from it. But it makes the mold less dense,
<lb />and it drinks in and attracts the gold better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
<lb />your molds from large works & pieces of wood, it
<lb />will not release well unless you <-boil-> make your wood
<lb />imbibe very hot wax. For the wood absorbs & drinks
<lb />& in this way attracts the plaster. You can assume the same
<lb />thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
<lb /><-l’ab-> saturate <-l’ouvra-> with very
<lb />hot wax the work on which you want to cast your plaster. For
<lb />by this means, it will not drink it up & will release very
<lb />neatly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the plaster shrinks, it will always make flashing. Seek the hard
<lb />kind and <-it-> put your molds well in the press before
<lb />casting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is not good when it
<lb />shrinks.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plants difficult to burn in the noyau
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Any plant which has a hard stem & like wood is very
<lb />difficult to burn in the noyau, such as asparagus,
<lb />thyme, & similar things, because they stay as charcoal
<lb />in the small conduits, & if they do not reduce well into
<lb />ashes, it is not possible to empty them from the mold.
<lb />Some reheat them, to do this, two or <-d-> three
<lb />times. Others, putting several plants together in the mold,
<lb />pass through <-threads-> the plants & the <-es->
<lb /><-molds-> circle of earth,
<lb />which is to receive the tempered sand, <-plusi->
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This does not proceed from plants that have a stem with lines, because
<lb />rosemary burns well, but it is in the nature of certain
<lb />plants.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f252" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />some threads, as much to secure the plants, in order that they do not
<lb />rise <-by-> when you throw in your clear sand, as to
<lb />give them venting when the mold is reheated. For, in doing this,
<lb />the <-mold-> thread burns & leaves some
<lb />empty space around the plants, which serves as vents & places for
<lb />evacuating, & to give air to the plants so that they burn better.
<lb />For what makes them stay as charcoal is that they burn in a
<lb />closed fire & without empty space because of their fine sprigs. Try,
<lb />therefore, to thicken the main stem with a little melted wax,
<lb />& let it cool, then mold it. And when the wax melts, it airs
<lb />it, the principal stem, with space & as if loose so that it burns
<lb />better. Or else, anoint them with oil of petrol or
<lb />sulfur, of turpentine, oil of
<lb />brick & similar things, or aquafortis or
<lb />eau-de-vie, or make sands with crocum, iron
<lb />scales, loops of iron, emery & things that
<lb />withstand several days of great firing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Animal bones are not so difficult to burn & reduce to
<lb />ashes, because once the flesh is burnt, the bones
<lb />remain loose & the weight of the quicksilver makes them break
<lb />& disintegrate, once calcined & burnt.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Asparagus always stays as charcoal, like little pins.
<lb />Try to take it, and thyme, at the beginning, when they are
<lb />growing, so that their stem is still thin.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds of plaster for wax
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When your mold of plaster is done & dried, take
<lb />heed that your mold be of good release, for sometimes it
<lb />happens that the animal, being wounded or thin & withered, makes
<lb />wrinkles, where <-retire-> its scales are, where the plaster enters. And this not being of good release,
<lb />the wax animal would attach itself & would break, & you would never
<lb />have it perfect. Take heed also to make your gates for the
<lb />wax very wide. Thus, & the gates should not be too thick.
<lb />They are made when <-the animal is->
</ab>

<lb />Founders’ earth
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is terre bolvene mixed with dung or
<lb />cloth waste, which withstands fire, which you need to always have
<lb />provision of to lute your molds that <-have
<lb />b-> are meant to serve for casting silver & that one needs to
<lb />reheat. Those where one needs to burn some flower or animal should not
<lb />be luted until they have been reheated once, and they have been cleaned
<lb />of bones & ashes remaining inside, and, having removed 
<lb />the clamps, you have opened the two halves to see if
<lb />they are cracked. For there is plaster that is not so
<lb />hard in the fire, one as the other. Moreover, there is some
<lb />which makes crusty the things which stay burning inside. And these are
<lb />imperfections that one needs to avoid, either <-by-> by bathing
<lb />well with eau-de-vie the animal before casting in the tempered sand,
<lb />or mixing in more or less brick or alum, or reheating the
<lb />brick more, or in place of the brick, mixing in
<lb />crucible bottoms & similar things which resist well
<lb />in the fire. Having therefore reheated your mold to burn it
<lb />inside, leave to cool well. And if it is neat & not cracked, put
<lb />the clamps back & lute it with this aforesaid
<lb />founders’ earth & sprinkle a little sifted ash
<lb />& let dry a little. But keep yourself from luting <-that they are
<lb />not-> until the molds are cold. Those for casting
<lb />silver, where there is nothing to burn inside, only need, except
<lb />when the gate & vents are made, luting & reheating once. Do not
<lb />lute the end of the mold where you want to make your gate,
<lb />but leave it uncovered & the exit of the vent as well. 
</ab>

<lb />The earth that locksmiths
<lb />use to braze or solder, which is
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />sandy clay earth, or else clay mixed with sand, after

<lb />luting your molds because this earth melts rather than
<lb />cracks. And any earth that melts <-is-> cannot be lacking

<ab>
<lb />Lute thickly your molds, & if they are small, you can
<lb />reheat them immediately in a good fire, especially those of
<lb />crocum.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the earth is good, & <-l-> does not crack
<lb />while reheating, & does not separate from the mold, the
<lb />molds will also not crack & will not make flashing at the
<lb />casting. Reheat with slow ease in a closed fire, & do not expose them
<lb />hot to the air.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lute rather thickly in two or three layers, especially right in the
<lb />joints, in order that the silver does not come out of the
<lb />mold.

<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the molds <-that-> were

<lb />    
<lb />The smallest molds are reheated more quickly.
<lb />Take <-them-> therefore, the first reheated ones when you cast, for
<lb />you can put several of them to reheat.
<lb />    
<lb />Light the charcoals first, in the forge or in some other

<lb />To test if your earth is good, before putting it on your

<lb />Casting in silver and gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Wanting to melt, always put for these two metals
<lb />a small stone of pulverized borax at the bottom of
<lb />the crucible & the gold and silver on top.
<lb />This makes it so that if the crucible gives off some vapor or
<lb />sour fumes, it will not impair these two metals. For
<lb />gold in particular, this is good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you have several molds to cast, do not think of filling them
<lb />in one cast, for the metal would be cold. But having cast while
<lb />hot & filling one, remelt & cast in the other.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />Some let the silver rest a little outside before casting.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />Gold and silver, melted with the aforesaid things, scarcely
<lb />become porous.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />For gold, one does not need <-d-> as much
<lb /><-tin-> crocum as feather alum.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When your mold starts to redden on the inside, <-&
<lb />that the cast-> <-loses its blackness,-> <-then put your-> & when
<lb />looking inside the cast you <-you-> do not see
<lb /><-plas-> a single point of blackness,
<lb />continue to maintain it in this heat &, if need be, add in some half-lit charcoals with your pincers. However,
<lb /><-com-> put in the forge your
<lb />crucible with a little ground borax at the bottom, &
<lb />the silver that you want to cast <-in your
<lb />forge-> should be on top, letting your
<lb />crucible reheat between the lit charcoals
<lb /><-jus-> <-without blowing-> until it is red, for
<lb />before, one ought not to blow. And when you do blow, push in a longish
<lb />& continuous movement the bellows, giving them a little
<lb />shake when pushing & another when pulling toward you. In this way,
<lb />the heat becomes stronger. <-Com->
<lb /><-Do not-> Take heed to raise sometimes your
<lb />crucible <-with the-> with hot pincers, 
<lb />because <-il-> if it is placed right in front of the
<lb />blast-pipe & the <-bellow b->
<lb /><-wind hits the-> wind of the bellows hits
<lb />the crucible, it will cool your silver rather than
<lb />heating it. Make sure that the lit charcoals support it from above the
<lb />blast-pipe, & take care that it is at a distance of
<lb />three good fingers from the wall of the
<lb />forge. In this way, it heats better. Therefore, when your
<lb />silver starts to melt, if you recognize that it is brittle,
<lb />seeing cracked & burst lumps, take the size of a
<lb />hazelnut of arsenic & two times as much of
<lb />raw tartar, coarsely pulverized, for in this way, they have more
<lb />ability to heat. And occasionally throw it in the crucible on the
<lb />silver, which clarifies it. But if you have some of that crust sublimated on a metal substance, which looks like
<lb />grain of steel, as previously described, take a little
<lb />of that, leaving # the others, & throw it
<lb />on your melted silver.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Small molds are reheated quickly, but big & small ones
<lb />should dry beforehand in the furnace, for the humidity of the
<lb />mold, by the <-e-> <-fo-> heat of the
<lb />furnace, is attracted outside. But the fierce heat of the
<lb />charcoals chases it from the exterior through the inside.

<lb />You will see that it will torment it & heat it very well and soon
<lb />render it very liquid & ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
<lb />be. When it is in this state & when it is very white and polished,
<lb />shining like quicksilver, prepare yourself to cast. And to this
<lb />effect, have some lean delicate sand, in a
<lb />terrine or another vessel, that you would
<lb />like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your sand, then, with your
<lb />pincers, take your well-reddened mold & place it
<lb />in this pit of sand. Cover immediately the opening of your mold
<lb />in order that no ash & dust enters inside, & then
<lb />enclose it with sand up to the edge of the gate & the vents. This done,
<lb />uncover your mold & throw on top of your well-melted
<lb />silver, the size of a pea or thereabouts, some
<lb />of this metallic grain, which will immediately spread through
<lb />all your silver & make it boil & turn. Cast as soon as
<lb />you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
<lb />making the silver run, since its crust heats it & clarifies
<lb />it. You can cast silver finer than the alloy from the capital
<lb />and like that of the real, but you must add this
<lb />grain in.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
<lb />a little borax in the melted silver, for even though
<lb />goldsmiths do not put any in, nevertheless it is good, and I have
<lb />seen it practiced well. Next, one puts in the crust of the substance at
<lb />two different times & then the metallic thing. Then make sure [illegible] that
<lb />it be placed at the end of your forge.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to blow the ash that is around your mold when
<lb />you hold it between the pincers, hold it with the opening at
<lb />the bottom, & blow.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When silver is well melted, you can uncover it and blow with the
<lb />small bellows, not continually like with gold, but only
<lb />to cast out the charcoals in order to put in the substances that
<lb />make it run.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Whitening of cast silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because one commonly casts in base silver, & especially the
<lb />Germans, and that such an alloy readily makes a film
<lb />or crust, <-which is contrary to-> <-our-> some
<lb />goldsmiths <-from France-> are usually quick
<lb />to whiten their works, especially rough ones, because they only
<lb />use common bullitoyre, which is tartar &
<lb />common salt, nearly as much of one as the other. But I
<lb />have seen an excellent German working thus. Having in my
<lb />presence cast a little lizard with an alloy of
<lb />teston, he made a greyish <-noi-> crust.
<lb />And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above-mentioned
<lb />bullitoyre of tartar & pulverized
<lb />common salt <-and-> mixed with common water, in the
<lb />fire of his forge. Once taken out, he brushed it. And
<lb />because it was not as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some
<lb />tartar in some paper until it was
<lb />black & no longer smoked. Then, he wetted the aforesaid tartar
<lb /><-d-> with the water of bullitoyre,
<lb />composed of salt & tartar, & covered all his
<lb />lizard with it. Then, he put it between the live <-of->
<lb />charcoals of his forge & blew a little. When the
<lb />lizard was red, he took it out, let it cool, then reheated it
<lb />in the bullitoyre. Next, he brushed it in
<lb />clear water. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Note that the bullitoyre for silver is never good
<lb />in a crucible because the water, taking the form of the
<lb /><-f-> tartar, evaporates. But the vessel
<lb />for boiling, being of copper, is excellent for the whitening of
<lb />silver & for the mixture which colors gold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />He took heed not to let his water of tartar boil so much that it
<lb />would have poured out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when this first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire & put it
<lb />back. He held as a secret this burned tartar put on top for
<lb />base silver.

<lb />are not very deep. For the metal runs more gently without being
<lb />hindered by vapors & fumes.

<lb />Spider molded on a leaf
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The very big ones usually have hairy feet, which are
<lb />vexing to mold if you do not lay them flat, or burn them with a
<lb />candle, or stiffen them & lay them flat <-with
<lb />some->, anointing them with wheat oil. Kill
<lb />them in vinegar & urine, like snakes
<lb /><-&->, or in eau-de-vie, and then shape them on a
<lb />well-made vine leaf or other thing. Next, you can give them back their
<lb />capricious hair with <-bourr-> the sieved
<lb />fine hair of cloth waste, having anointed them <-with a-> with
<lb />fish glue or similar. Their true color is of
<lb />vinegar & verdet, & then fumigate them in various
<lb />places with sulfur. Having made your <-tourt->
<lb />clay slab, place on it your vine leaf, and the
<lb />dead spider in the middle, & pierce with a point of

<lb />& the leaf together. Next, place diagonally small points of

<lb />Then fix, with a little melted wax and the point of a hot
<lb />iron wire, the end of the legs, adapting them with the end
<lb />of small pincers. Do the same thing with the end of the

<lb />To make the gate

<lb />tail & the bottom of the body with a
<lb />little wax, melted & applied with the hot iron
<lb />wire, as you know. In
<lb />this way, when the leaf burns & the
<lb />wax is melted, there will remain
<lb />two little holes in the leaf
<lb />which will be the gate of the spider.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />🜊
<lb />Once the wax is cool, scrape the excess with the point of a
<lb />penknife in order that the end of the legs stay neat. Next,
<lb />place the circle of earth around & cast your tempered
<lb />sand, like for other things. In this manner, you will need to burn the
<lb />vine leaf in the mold, otherwise not. And to cast more
<lb />easily, let the animal die fully, in order that, when struggling, it does
<lb />not mix up its legs. Having made your first cast, uncover the reverse of
<lb />the leaf and make the second cast.

<lb />Molding a crab
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold it well, because one needs
<lb />to proceed differently than with other animals, because its shell is
<lb />very difficult to <-mou-> burn & in this case, one
<lb /><-it-> needs to sometimes reheat the mold three
<lb />or four times. And with all of this, it leaves a hard crust, grey like
<lb />ash. But because it does not mold in one piece & one cast
<lb />like plants, but rather in two casts like snakes that release
<lb />well, one removes this crust, not with quicksilver, which
<lb />would do nothing, after it
<lb />has been opened, with the very fine point of a penknife with
<lb />dexterity, as with the little crusts of the second cast, which enter in
<lb />the nooks that the sand or the molded animal made. But,
<lb /><-la-> because it has curved legs,
<lb />here is the cunning & secret for releasing it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />It is painted like a crayfish.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />Therefore, as you have molded it on
<lb />one side, which is on the back, in the same fashion as others, uncover its
<lb />belly & all its curved legs. Make your second cast in the same fashion
<lb />as others, but as it will have set, keep from opening the mold
<lb />until you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved
<lb />legs, you would break everything. In this lies the dexterity. If you
<lb />recognize, after having reheated & opened it, that the crust is not
<lb />burned enough, reheat until it is.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-Know that-> For opening the mold, there is
<lb />no need to soak it, for once reheated, it will open by itself.

<lb />Molded waxes
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Figures of wax composed of ceruse & lead
<lb />white are not for burning & melting in a mold where you
<lb />want to cast gold & silver, for this would sour it.
<lb />And then, if you think about taking away these waxes composed of
<lb />things coming from the metals reheated in the mold, you
<lb />will be wrong, because, the asperity of the fire making them seethe
<lb /><-ir->, the wax goes away & the composition
<lb />of the ceruse or other metallic color attacks the mold.
<lb />And for this reason, if you want to rough out something
</ab>
<ab>

</ab>
<ab>

<lb />White wax is more delicate than the other & it does not leave

<lb />in a round form to cast it in gold and silver, put
<lb />only in your wax what you prepare for this effect
<lb /><-sino-> from all these drugs, except casting with
<lb />melted sulfur, since it is melted, & candle
<lb />smoke. The melted sulfur goes to the bottom and nevertheless
<lb />leaves its quality in the wax, making it melt promptly in the fire
<lb />& giving it firmness. In this way, you can melt in the fire this
<lb />roughed out <-ci-> figure of wax. But if it is
<lb />composed of ceruse or suchlike, it is necessary that you
<lb />put your mold in boiling water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For figures of flat wax, there is no need for all this, for the
<lb />wax releases & does not stay in the <-la->
<lb />mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the cast of tin or lead becomes porous
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
<lb />wax which you can gild afterward with silver or
<lb />gold. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
<lb />℥ <-d’est-> of lead for
<lb />one lb of tin is good. But if you cast with lead
<lb />for a thick thing, one needs for one lb of the
<lb />latter, two ℥ of tin, for the
<lb />lead, being fatty & weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
<lb />cast a large lizard like a natural one. In thick things,
<lb /><-if-> which keep their heat a long time, if there is little
<lb />tin, it makes it porous. Your mold must not be cold, but
<lb />of such a heat that you can handle it without harm, or that you can
<lb />keep your finger in the gate without burning yourself.
<lb />It is also necessary that your lead or tin be as if red.
<lb />Melt first the lead & then the alloy of tin on top.
<lb />And as you want to cast, put a piece of rosin & then a
<lb />little looking-glass tin. If you put too
<lb />much lead into the tin, it does not run very thin. And to know
<lb />this, if <-l-> the tin cries loudly,
<lb />it is a sign there is not too much lead. If it cries weakly, that
<lb />means that there is too much. Take heed
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can solder with the <-l’es-> same substance,
<lb />then repair it with the burin, file,

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tin is a metal that penetrates, that becomes porous &
<lb />burns, and is fanciful to use, more than gold and

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lead wants not only to be red, but also lively & runny &
<lb />liquid as water, which is a sign of its perfect heat, & the
<lb />mold <-ch-> is so hot that you can bear putting
<lb />your finger in it. Do not open until it is
<lb />cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much for it as for gold
<lb />& silver, when it exits by the vents.

<lb />not to open your mold too hot, for this sours it, makes it

<lb />contract.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mold made in two casts
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is opened, once reheated, to clean it; next, one puts the
<lb />clamps on again, one lutes the mold &
<lb />especially the joints, then one slowly dries the earth. And then,
<lb />as it no longer smokes, one leaves the mold to cool until you can
<lb />hold it without harm. Next, put in the presses or in the sand
<lb />in a terrine, & cast in tin. For if you
<lb />were to cast in silver or gold, it would be necessary that
<lb />your mold be reheated twice & cast when it would be completely 
<lb />red.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your mold <-f->, through the fault of the
<lb />plaster, retracts in the fire, you need to open it
<lb />after the first reheating to tighten it again, & clamp it
<lb />and lute again, and tighten again.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Method for reheating the molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Light charcoals in the forge, & then arrange
<lb />them in rows in a corner of it, according to the size of your
<lb />mold, in such a way that it can be furnished with three or 4
<lb />fingers all around, and especially at the bottom of
<lb />the mold, which is the thickest <-and which->. Your
<lb />charcoals thus arranged, place your molds on top of
<lb />them, & not on a grate, as some do, because they
<lb />would take the fire too harshly. And leave for some time thus, &
<lb />little & by little, warm your oven, always adding some lit
<lb />charcoal. And as long as the mold is humid, the
<lb />charcoals will be as if died down from below. But as it dries,
<lb />they will kindle by themselves. And when it is dry on one side, turn it to
<lb />the other. And when it is dry on both, & it will no longer smoke. At
<lb />that moment, invigorate the fire & cover it with lit
<lb />charcoals. And as it will begin to redden, do not blow the
<lb />charcoals with the little bellows, for this would make it
<lb /><-blow-> burst. And similarly, when it is red, keep it well
<lb />covered with lit charcoals & do not uncover it, for it would
<lb />crack. Make sure wind from a window does not beat upon it. Let
<lb />cool
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you want to reheat your molds, <-&-> be they
<lb />luted or not, mark on the belly the place to put at the bottom,
<lb />against the lit charcoals, <-that-> because if the
<lb />ardor of the fire were to make them crack, it would be better that this be
<lb />at the belly & from underneath than on the back.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your mold is small, one ought not to leave it
<lb /><-rest-> so much in the fire, for it corrupts and cracks there,
<lb />for it reheats more quickly than a big one.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f263" />
<ab>
<lb />

<ab>
<lb />by itself. When it begins to redden, it is soon red everywhere.
<lb />But make sure, through the gate, that it is red at the bottom & that
<lb />nothing appears black.

<lb />Common sand from the mine
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In a frame, if one casts hot, it becomes porous; therefore,
<lb />one only needs to dry it out.

<lb />Crocum ferri
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having <-d-> passed it through vinegar &
<lb />reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on porphyry,
<lb />until no roughness was perceived on the fingernail. Then,
<lb />I wet it with very good vinegar & 
<lb />left it there <-a-> two or three days, stirring
<lb />it several times each day. Finally, I boiled it
<lb />& reddened <-in-> the pot &
<lb />crocum all together in the four à
<lb />vent. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
<lb />can be pulverized very finely between the fingers. I
<lb />put some in the sand, <-a-> half as much as
<lb />feather alum. I tempered the sand quite thinly & molded
<lb />out of it a very small female lizard, which molded very neatly &
<lb />delicately & very finely. The crocum ferri does not
<lb />render the mold harder, but it firms it. And when your
<lb />mold is soft & fatty when scraping it with the
<lb />fingernail, it is a sign that the crocum is
<lb />good, very fine, & well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
<lb />mold, because it is a friend to gold. And I believe that
<lb />silver would come out well. And that the mold, through
<lb />this means, does not crack. Make it from filings of
<lb />needles.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />I have tried to make it so the molds where it is mixed do not crack
<lb />during reheating & thus do not make flashing.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />It is better made with distilled vinegar.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One can put some amongst the molds, where you want to cast
<lb />silver, for it firms the molds, and you will find it so,
<lb />by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds
<lb />very neatly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This one is appropriate for all molds & keeps them from
<lb />breaking & bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
<lb />several casts. The one of steel fillings & needles is redder
<lb />& better.

<lb />Feet of small<-s-> female lizards for

<lb />Because the feet of these, which are very small, are very delicate,
<lb />when you have molded the top and <-d-> you uncover the belly
<lb />& the bottom of the feet, cover them lightly with wax &
<lb />then cast the second mold. And the wax being removed, it
<lb />will leave a <-g-> little gate for the said feet. And
<lb />should the bottom of these come off in one piece, you can repair it well. And
<lb />the scales from the top of the toes will come out well.

<lb />Marks from the points of iron wire which are found

</ab>

<lb /><-L-> With the points, one has previously

<lb />there remains around the hole some moisture and a little exudation,
<lb />which hinders the sand from covering the point & there
<lb />always remains some little opening <-g->. But to avoid
<lb />this, you can plant in the slab of earth an
<lb />iron point, <-arro-> cleaned &
<lb />rounded at the top end, & on this end place there a little hard
<lb />wax or <-some-> a little mastic or
<lb />cement and, by means of the hot iron

<lb />when you come to uncover the belly & the throat to make the second

<lb />enclosed molds, close the mold again & put the
<lb />clamps on again, but not in the first place where they were.
<lb />Lute again & dry again. But if it is for a cast with
<lb />silver or gold, lute with the remainder of the sand
<lb />that was used, for it is the safest. If your mold, while

<lb />Thing that does not release

<ab>
<lb />One needs to cut it to make it burn in the mold, but cut it

<lb />When you mold small female lizards and you want to uncover the part

<lb />it moves, does not remove the legs from their place, where it is
<lb />vexing to put them back. When you remove the little points which
<lb />hold the legs, fix them & press them with something, in order that,

<lb />You can entwine a snake <-entwined-> with a

<lb />release, cut what you can & leave the rest to burn. And to keep a
<lb />wall lizard, which is small, in the mouth of the
<lb />snake, which is raised & needs to be supported in the air
<lb /><-po-> because the head of the snake is posed
<lb />    raised, put underneath the wall lizard <-se->
<lb />an elevation of earth suited to support it. And if you put your

<lb />& will burn better afterward. <-if you see-> These entwinings are
<lb />also made to cover a wound or fault in the animals, which one usually
<lb />wounds when one catches them. Also, do not forget to attach & join
<lb />with some wax <-s->, finely applied with hot
<lb />iron wire, all the parts of the animal which pass one on top
<lb />of the other or those that you notice are not well fixed on the

<lb />avoid putting points, which should not be put except at the

<lb />& delicate parts in the middle of the lizard’s feet, the
<lb />nails of which you will enter into the clay slab, in
<lb />order that they remain secure. When you have made the first cast &
<lb />uncovered the belly of the animal, do not forget to put small thin
<lb /><-s-> slabs of wax at the end of the
<lb />lizard’s legs. But, if it is a small wall lizard,
<lb />lightly cover with wax the entire bottom of the foot,
<lb /><-and-> and <-this-> the wax, being removed after
<lb />the second cast, leaves a cavity which fills these small fingers with
<lb />metal, & then one repairs them. Take heed therefore to attach
<lb />well with wax the parts of the animal which pass one over the
<lb />other, in order that the wetted sand entering between two does not take it
<lb />away. <-And if-> For if this were to happen, the <-mold

<lb />Sand of crocum

<ab>
<lb />One can use the mixture of crocum ferri in

<lb />Secret for soldering gold and silver in

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If some piece of small foot does not come out well in gold or
<lb />silver, by fault of not having made a gate of
<lb />wax underneath, beat some soldering gold very thinly, then cut it in
<lb />as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this phlegm
<lb /> or white thick <-which-> saliva that is found on
<lb />the teeth, & with the point of a burin,
<lb />apply it to the place you want to solder, & place there a
<lb />little spangle of gold; & next, with a little fat
<lb />earth wetted with saliva, make a small layer on the
<lb />opposite side to hold the solder better. Next, pulverize on top a
<lb />little borax & put in the fire. Boiled water of
<lb />quince seed & others also.

<lb />Gate
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that it be longish with regard to the thing that you
<lb />molded. And for big molds, at the very least, it is necessary
<lb />that it have four or five fingers of length. You can
<lb />make it wide up until the middle & then divide it in three points in
<lb />this way. And as much as the molded thing will be small, it is also necessary
<lb />that your points be small. And in the middle of the gate & of its
<lb />points, make there some openings in order to prevent the fury of the
<lb />metal & make it run gently. One also needs to
<lb /><-c-> conjoin the folded parts of the animal with little
<lb />notched lines, <-a-> especially the end of the tail or
<lb />other delicate part, in order that the metal flows everywhere
<lb />& carries itself from <-e l-> one part to the
<lb />other.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not forget to make a gate of wax for the feet of 
<lb />    
<lb />lizards & delicate things like this.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have molded an animal in the first part of the
<lb />mold, do not let this part dry before you have taken away the
<lb />said animal, for the mold, in drying, contracts and would also
<lb />make the animal contract. Keep it therefore in some moist &
<lb />humid place until you have
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> done it.

<lb />Vine leaf and small frog
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take vine leaves to mold as they are in growth, likewise with
<lb />all plants & flowers, or a young vine growing again after
<lb />having been cut, or when they rebud in autumn, because the
<lb />new leaves are more lumpy & have more apparent lineation. On the
<lb />contrary, old leaves are smooth on the inside & pierced in several
<lb />places. Therefore place your leaf bottom down on the clay
<lb />slab, and secure it with small points, nevertheless
<lb />leaving it its natural curve. And make a notch in the
<lb />clay to hide the stem at the first cast, which, once made
<lb />& dry, you will take away the stem from the leaf & clean with it
<lb />well with small bristle brushes & fix it with a small mound
<lb />of clay. Next, make several gates around the leaf with wax,
<lb />as you know, & <-gec-> make the gate thin & with
<lb />several lines & lumpy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The vine leaf is painted with green made of stil de grain
<lb />yellow & verd de terre.

<lb />You can cast on the leaf a spider or frog &

<lb />Casting in ☼
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a crucible with a capacity suitable for what you want
<lb />to put in it, coarsely pestle a little borax & put it at the
<lb />bottom, then the ☼ on top. Arrange the crucible on the charcoals of the forge in such a
<lb />way that the wind of the bellows blows on it from underneath
<lb />and not at the side, for this would cool it & would not heat it enough.
<lb />Make sure also that it is distanced three fingers from
<lb />the wall of the forge, in order that it can be surrounded with
<lb />charcoal. Let the said crucible reheat until it is quite
<lb />red. Then, make your boy blow on it with long and strong
<lb />pushes, for in this way it heats <-well-> better. And
<lb />nevertheless, <-blow by-> when the gold is melted, blow on
<lb />top with small bellows, for the gold will become
<lb />brittle & take on a crust. And as long as it makes
<lb />swirling fumes as you blow thus, it means that is not soft
<lb />enough for the cast. Uncover therefore the crucible, &
<lb />without moving <-ch-> it from its place and without
<lb />interrupting the blowing, make it lean toward you in order to see well
<lb />inside. Throw in it the size of a bean of borax,
<lb />& blow inside in jolts with the small bellows. But if
<lb />there is charcoal inside, blow a little stronger to make it go
<lb />out. And if the gold smokes & swirls, put some more
<lb />borax in and <-note-> blow on top, making sure that, if it
<lb />is still brittle & not softened enough, it does not cover itself
<lb />when you blow, as if it had cooled. But if it does not make this sign,
<lb />it is soft enough. At that point, blow very strongly in order
<lb />to heat it well, and as you think it is hot enough, throw in on top, in
<lb />the crucible, the couleur,
<lb />composed, as said before, of verdet, saltpeter,
<lb />sal ammoniac & borax, a little. And
<lb /><-let rest-> blow always with the small bellows, and the
<lb />gold will become shiny like
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you cast in gold some important piece, lute your
<lb />mold with the same sand where <-there is-> there is some
<lb />crocum.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to cast some large work in gold or which is
<lb />important, make at the foot of the forge, or at one end of it,
<lb />a four à vent, where you can hold your
<lb />mold in the completely <-n-> red sand. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One can cast two or three lb of gold.
</ab>

<lb />

<lb />a mirror. And when you want to [illegible] cast, put again a
<lb />little of the couleur & let rest a little, always
<lb />blowing with the small & large bellows. Finally, arrange
<lb />your very red mold between the moulets or in a
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />crucible full of very hot sand, & cast. And when it has set,
<lb />throw, if you want, in water. For gold does not get
<lb />damaged like tin, which jumps.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To melt gold in ingots, it is of no importance to
<lb /><-gec-> blow on top with the little bellows.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For large works, the crucible of sand needs to be put in a
<lb />fourneau à vent, to become entirely red at the end of
<lb />the fournaise.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The gold that the wind hits or that one forges becomes

<lb />statues, put between the gold & the latten a plate
<lb />of lead. And before reheating the gold & putting it again
<lb />in the fire, soak in aquafortis & it will be
<lb />soft.

<lb />It is enough that the gate be of the thickness <-[illegible]-> of

<pb facs="#f271" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For casting in latten
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The latten from skillets in which one makes the mush for
<lb />little children, which is soft, is appropriate for
<lb />the cast. Some say that German tokens <-are->
<lb />contain a lot of calamine. However, as they are thin, the
<lb />calamine exhales out when melting them, as it does in
<lb />all <-meta-> remelted latten, which, through melting
<lb />again, would return to red. However, fresh calamine & on its own, put
<lb />again on melted latten, makes it run & cast neatly, because
<lb />the one that is in the remelted <-de-> latten is
<lb />half corrupted from its nature, & makes it become porous &
<lb />blusters because it is disposed to exhaling. Therefore, use
<lb />calamine alone, on its own, very recent, on the melted
<lb />latten. Take heed to cast very hot & that your mold
<lb />be red like for gold, silver, copper &
<lb />metal. If you cast with recent calamine, keep 
<lb />away from the fumes, for they are pernicious. I wanted to use
<lb />German tokens to cast medals & took thirty & xii
<lb />nails of rosette, like for chairs, which are of
<lb />soft latten. This substance, containing a lot of
<lb />calamine, like all strong yellow latten, has made great fumes,
<lb />which is what prevents latten from running and makes it
<lb />porous. Make many vents & cast very hot, that your
<lb />latten is white like water or melted silver &
<lb />similar to a very polished steel mirror. The second fusion comes
<lb />out better, for what calamine there is has been exhaled and does not make
<lb />fumes as much. If it is in a frame which does not break
<lb />& withstands <-a->, the second cast comes out neat
<lb />because it is imbued with calamine fumes, which embrace &
<lb />receive the second one. Sal ammoniac alone, put in
<lb />latten, renders it neat & shiny. Huile
<lb />tingente even more so. It does not need any sand other than the
<lb />previous en noyau & that the mold be red like for
<lb />gold. Make many vents. And if you cast yellowed latten
<lb />with the prepared tutty, you will not have any bad fumes.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This metal is very fanciful to cast because of the calamine
<lb />smoke, and one ought not to leave it <-pass-> rest even
<lb />a little bit outside the fire, like some do with silver, for it
<lb />is immediately cold when it feels the air and the
<lb />wind. It always leaves some type of tail, like glass, when
<lb />you cast it. Casters do not usually take that very yellow
<lb />latten, because of the calamine passed through the fire. But
<lb />when wanting to cast red copper, they yellow it either with
<lb />fresh calamine or with prepared tutty. Wanting to cast,
<lb />one purifies it well of charcoal with a stalk of
<lb />copper or iron, and one covers it with a
<lb />cloth soaked in pig fat mixed with
<lb />saltpeter or sal ammoniac, to keep it from
<lb />the wind & from cooling. 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f272" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For casting in red copper
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Pure red copper from a cauldron or other thin works
<lb />is appropriate for casting. And to make it run, throw in some sal
<lb />ammoniac, & when you are ready to cast, put in a little fine
<lb />tin & very little. And note that one needs to cast copper
<lb />very hot in the mold, which needs to also be inflamed &
<lb />entirely red like for gold, silver, latten &
<lb />metal. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is
<lb />smooth, thin & shiny like a mirror <-of cu-> of
<lb />steel, newly polished, or like melted silver. Keep it from
<lb />the wind, for it will quickly cool. Stop the cast with
<lb />tows <-or-> to keep it from cooling.
<lb />    
<lb />    
<lb /> Red copper
<lb />comes out more neatly than latten, which has strong smoke
<lb />that prevents it from running. I molded it en noyau neatly like
<lb />the principal & thin like paper. It is necessary that it
<lb />be so hot that it is white & shiny & polished like melted
<lb />silver and like a mirror. I cast it in the same sand as
<lb />above en noyau.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Copper and latten are the longest to melt, longer than any
<lb />other metal, especially red copper. But also it flows
<lb />& comes out very neat, provided that it is cast very hot, that it is
<lb />like water.

<lb />Removing your mold from the fire, plant it in

<lb />Pulverize everything separately, & next mix everything in a

<lb />that everything dissolves like wax, making many colors. Let it
<lb /><-everything-> set & put a little of it on each
<lb />melted metal, & it will run marvelously.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Founders of large casts for statues throw in much
<lb />tartar to clean it of its filth & nastiness,
<lb />& much sal ammoniac to render it thin & neat. And when
<lb />they want to cast, they put in much tin. The cold &
<lb />humidity strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the

<lb />Tempering sand for molds of flat medals
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Flat medals of wax or metal are oiled very
<lb />lightly & then are touched with a paintbrush with
<lb />eau-de-vie. And in order that the mold, wetted with
<lb />water, takes without refusing the oiled thing, one heats
<lb />the water well for tempering the sand, for with cold water
<lb />it would refuse. Medals are oiled because they are not malleable
<lb />& thus could break the mold. And animals, which are
<lb />malleable, do not want to be oiled. Hot water should be
<lb />of such heat that you cannot hold your finger
<lb />there without feeling strong heat. Temper your sand thicker for flat medals & solids than for lizards & fine things.
<lb />Your sand having set, clean & scrape your mold on one side
<lb />& the other, & make a notch at the foot & the border of the
<lb />medal on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away
<lb />better. Lower also the mold, scraping the 
<lb />medal all around, in order that, from all sides, you can take it away
<lb />without it corrupting the mold. Next, make your scorings around
<lb /><-of the-> the first mold cast <-mes->,
<lb />in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &
<lb />especially make a notch at the bottom of the mold
<lb />where the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of
<lb />the gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first mold in
<lb />water, oil it, & thus it will not be imbibed. Rub
<lb />the reverse of the medal with eau-de-vie & secondly cast,
<lb />tempering in hot water. If you have molded a medal en noyau, 
<lb />having made the first cast & this one having set,
<lb />outline, with the point of a knife, the surround of the medal,
<lb />in order that it is raised on the cast & not buried in it. Then
<lb />having made the second cast & having opened your mold,
<lb /><-have-> take away the medal in one go, with <-one-> two
<lb />knife points <-q->, and that one takes it from
<lb />the side of the gate & the other from the side of the head, which is
<lb />opposite.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take care not to oil your medal too much, for if the oil
<lb />seeps out, it diverts the sand from becoming smooth & amassing, &
<lb />makes it wavy & lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal
<lb /><-of the p-> with the point of an oiled
<lb />paintbrush, & then spread the oil everywhere.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make especially sure that the gate is the widest you can
<lb /><-p-> toward the medal & embraces it well, that the
<lb />entrance of the gate is ample, always narrowing toward the medal. Do
<lb />not forget also to notch the entrance of the gate.
</ab>

</ab>

<pb facs="#f274" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to cast gold, silver, copper, or
<lb />latten, it is necessary that they be perfectly red &
<lb />inflamed on the inside when you cast, & perfectly reheated two
<lb />times if there is something inside to be burnt & cleaned.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The molds of animals that one burns must be heated in
<lb />such a way that the animal burns. But if it has thick bones, it is
<lb />troublesome to pull out & ☿ often breaks
<lb />some fine things by its weightiness. One does not put
<lb />☿ in molds that can open. This readily
<lb />happens with flowers, the mold of these does not open because
<lb />they are made all in one go.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you want to reheat your molds, put the clamps
<lb />on the joints, in order that, when reheating, they do not bend,
<lb />contract, or break. This is done after the gate is made.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The scrapings of the mold can still be used, using them in
<lb />place of brick, after having reheated them, & also the
<lb />pieces of the molds that have been used. One lutes with it
<lb />also important things, like works of gold or silver. One
<lb />also reheats it, & prepares it with <-se-> sal 
<lb />ammoniac water, as spat from Germany, & it is
<lb />excellent sand for frames for all metals.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The molds of things which one needs to burn inside the mold are
<lb /><-souf-> not opened until the thing that is inside is
<lb />burnt, like with molds of crayfish, crabs,
<lb />stag beetles, portraits & pieces of sulfured
<lb />black wax, which do not release well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to mold on brick or wood because they
<lb /><-l’ea-> drink & attract water too soon, and
<lb />do not allow the sand to set. It would never be better than on a
<lb />fresh clay slab. Yet, I have experienced that grey
<lb />earth dries the mold too soon. The yellow is
<lb />better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For medals and flat things it is necessary that the sand be thick
<lb />enough wet, because it sets quickly. And when the sand is thus thick,
<lb />one can hit and shake the table where the mold is
<lb />placed, to make it run everywhere. But when the sand is thin, like for
<lb />flowers and plants, one ought not to hit, nor when there is something
<lb />attached with wax or another thing that is subject to coming off,
<lb />like crayfish legs or similar things. And if the sand is, by
<lb />chance, too thick, you promptly put in it some
<lb />[<-pour->] water. Having put the sand in
<lb />water, <-it-> examine that it is thick at the bottom &
<lb />thin on top. The thinnest is cast at the beginning, and then blow,
<lb />& the thickest at the end in order to fortify the
<lb />mold.

<lb />Casting of lead and tin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When it is often melted, it becomes brittle &
<lb /><-fl-> frangible because it is cast very hot &
<lb />renders it half calcined. Therefore, use new.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The alloy that I have put in use for lizards &
<lb />snakes is two ℥ of fine tin for one lb
<lb />of new & unadulterated lead. The mold is made of the
<lb />aforesaid sand, common to all metals; when it is reheated let it
<lb />cool until you can hold your finger without harm
<lb />in the hole of the gate. As for lead, one melts it in a
<lb />crucible <-ju-> in the fire, with
<lb />bellows, until the crucible & the lead are
<lb />red. When it is in this state, purge it of charcoal, either
<lb />with a scraper made for this purpose or with the wind of the
<lb />little bellows. <-l-> This done, let it rest
<lb />thus red, & reheat a little on its own, then throw in, if you want,
<lb />a little rosin to burn the filth. However some find it
<lb />better not to put any in, because it leaves filth. But, when they
<lb />are ready to cast, they ought not to forget to throw inside, as well,
<lb />as much as a bean of looking-glass tin for each
<lb />lb of lead, and that it <-e-> should be
<lb />red like melted metal when it enters in the mold. And if
<lb />the mold is big, it is better to put it in a press, in
<lb />order that it joins well & that the lead does not spread outside the mold. However, should this happen & that
<lb />for the first or second or third time your mold has not filled,
<lb />cast boldly, for, provided that your metal is red, it will set
<lb />again, & join with the other, and come out very neat, like the
<lb />principal. The same can be said for fine tin for thin things.
<lb />And the alloy of fine tin is one ℥ of new lead

<lb />Note that if you want to cast them in cuttlefish

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not
<lb />got
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take some white wax, which is more appropriate for this work
<lb />than anything else because it is firmer & does not leave as much
<lb />filth, as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose,
<lb />& no more, and half as much charcoal, pestled &
<lb />finely passed through a linen or a sleeve.
<lb />The charcoal gives color and body to the wax,
<lb />which would otherwise be transparent & the features would not be
<lb />seen as well. Therefore, put your wax to melt in the charcoal fire. And when it will be well melted & liquid, take, for a
<lb />bowl with handles full of melted wax, as much
<lb />sulfur <-la-> as a large
<lb />walnut. Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire, & when
<lb />it is melted, do not leave it on the fire, because it will become
<lb />too hard, but take it away & agitate it always with a
<lb />little stick, & let it finish its bubbling, & when it is as
<lb />liquid as water, throw it in the wax that you have removed
<lb />from the fire. And mix & always stir the one & the other, in
<lb />order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always stirring & in several
<lb />goes, the aforesaid pulverized charcoal [<-in several
<lb />goes->]. And as it will be well incorporated, take heed if
<lb />your wax has passed its high heat, which you will recognize
<lb />when it no longer smokes, when it makes large tracts
<lb /><-se-> <-re->pulling at the
<lb />edges, & motionless & close <-to-> one to the other.
<lb />For, if you were to cast too hot, you could not separate your wax
<lb />from the mold, & it would set in the cast. When it is in
<lb />this good state, stir it with a little stick, in order that
<lb />the pulverized charcoal is everywhere & not placed
<lb />at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your mold, little by
<lb />little, & not in one go, because the wax, by its
<lb />unctuousness, does not flow
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This black sulfured wax is for modeling round figures that are
<lb />not for releasing and that one needs to burn in the mold à noyau 
<lb />before opening it, <-po-> like those
<lb />which have arms & legs out front or entwined. And then this
<lb />wax, by means of sulfur, melts with very little heat and
<lb />exits without leaving any filth. If, by chance, the pestled
<lb />charcoal remains there as ash, by opening the mold
<lb />& blowing inside, it stays neat.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To make snakes with wax, or another thing to fix on a
<lb />candle, one needs to cast with modeling wax of all
<lb />colors.

<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f278" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> like other things, & on this occasion, you can cast two or
<lb />three times until your mold is full. As for the mold which
<lb />is of white plaster, pulverized & reheated as for
<lb />previous sands, you should make it well in advance, for
<lb />it serves several times. But before you use it, soak it for a good
<lb />hour in cold water & for at least
<lb />as long in water so hot, that, at
<lb />the beginning, you cannot hold your finger in it.
<lb />And <-q-> take heed that it does not imbibe
<lb /><-b-> more, <-thus-> but rather that it shows
<lb />itself to be very wet everywhere, without the water being imbibed in it.
<lb />And, removing it from the hot water, closed, cast your wax
<lb />in such a state of heat as has been said. And neither the first
<lb />nor second cast come out readily until the mold is imbibed. Let it cool
<lb />before opening it, in order that the cast thing does not break. You will
<lb />recognize that the cast is good when the wax tipped out of the mold is thin and smooth. Remember to make many
<lb />gates all along the mold, in order that the wax may run
<lb />better, thus
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make the first
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> gate twice as large as for other molds. And if, in
<lb />the first cast, your work becomes porous and does not come out neat
<lb /><-[illegible]->, it is all the same, for it is necessary that you
<lb />realise that the three or four first ones are not readily good. In the
<lb />first one, you recognize if there are some barbs, which keep from
<lb />releasing well and you remove them if they do not remove
<lb />themselves at the second or third first casts. And the more
<lb />you will cast, the neater you will make it, and your mold will serve
<lb />you for more than a hundred times if it is well managed. But it is
<lb />good to soak it one night or one
<lb />day before casting in it, in order that it be well
<lb />imbibed. The same must be done for fruits of sugar. This
<lb />wax is very soft & amiable & pliant as
<lb />copper, and it is so strong because of the sulfur, which
<lb />renders it meltable much before the other, such that you can prove it on a
<lb />hot slate. And the sulfur that you will have put
<lb />in it will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at the
<lb />bottom. Having thus passed through the wax, it does not inflame
<lb />from a candle. And on this occasion <-that->, I
<lb />think it will cast very neatly for medals. One uses the same wax
<lb />in place of varnish to engrave
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When your animal is cast, cut with a hot penknife the flashing
<lb />& superfluous things. And if you want to refold it & twist it
<lb />around on some stick or taper, put it to soften
<lb /><-on-> in hot water, and hold it while twisting it
<lb />around.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cut down the protuberance of the gates, in order that they are smooth
<lb />& that the wax has more of the silver to run in one
<lb />go without turning around in the folds of the snake.

<lb />I tried plaster &

<lb />mold was very neat, having lightly oiled & rubbed
<lb />with eau-de-vie my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,
<lb />becoming narrower up to the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate
<lb />which embraced well the medal. I dried the mold well on a slow
<lb />fire &, at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it
<lb />cool in such a way that I could hold my finger
<lb />to it without burning myself. I made an alloy of 4
<lb />℥ of tin & six
<lb />deniers of lead. I cast red, and it came out
<lb />well. Next, I put in for 4 ℥ of
<lb />tin, xii deniers of lead; it came out
<lb />very well.

<lb />

<lb />& with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from
<lb />the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
<lb />more. You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the
<lb />bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
<lb />want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.

<lb />Casting of lead and tin in plaster

<ab>
<lb />If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very

<lb />cast in plaster & brick, mixed like above, and not in
<lb />plaster alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
<lb />it is not accompanied. But, with brick, it holds well.
<lb />However, take heed to dry out your mold at length & on a
<lb />slow fire & with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But
<lb />when your work is of flowers or other things that want <-to
<lb />be-> their molds reheated & set ablaze, mix in some

<lb />Molding a crayfish

<lb />If some little thing is missing from it, you
<lb />can reattach it or else fill it with goldsmith’s
<lb />cement,
<lb />because
<lb />it
<lb />can be
<lb />painted.
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The crayfish is one of the most fanciful to mold, but also
<lb />provides an example for casting many other very difficult things. Males
<lb />are distinguished by the eggs that females carry and by the four
<lb /><-legs-> little white leglets at the back that males
<lb /><-ap-> have inside their tail, after the
<lb />eight main legs. It is only a good thing to dry them out a little,
<lb />because the lumps only come out <-hard-> rougher & more
<lb />beautiful, for everything that is of shell does not diminish. It is true
<lb />that if you let them dry too much, these little inside leglets diminish
<lb />& become more slender & do not have as much body. If also they
<lb />are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Take heed, therefore,
<lb />to use moderation. They have some hair between the legs & at the end
<lb />of the tail. And because all hair is vexing to mold, because it
<lb />gets mixed up with the sand & is not released, you can burn it with
<lb />a hot iron on the crayfish, so that no one sees
<lb />it. As for animals that have hair or feathers, it is necessary that you
<lb />anoint them with olive wheat oil, which
<lb />is quickly dry & which will keep the hair flat & spread out.
<lb />Thus, you will have the form of your animal and the hair will also show,
<lb />but made wavy, and this is something which can be repaired. If your
<lb />crayfish has eggs, which are delicate and which
<lb />would be awkward to uncover without breaking, you would do better to
<lb />make the first cast on the belly & eggs, in order that
<lb /><-you-> you only need to uncover the back, which is hard &
<lb />easy to handle. And the belly & the eggs will remain in the
<lb />mold, and one will need to burn them inside before opening your
<lb />mold <-& en-> for the second time. Thus,
<lb /><-all-> it will open easily, for what is burned will no longer be
<lb />attached. Thus, the second cast, which is made on the first one, which
<lb />has set well, separates easily from the first after having been
<lb />reheated, which is a singular secret for similar molds.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not forget to rub with
<lb />eau-de-vie before molding.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Stag beetles, crayfish
<lb />& crabs are molded in the same fashion.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your crayfish <-a
<lb />d-> has no eggs, mold the back on top & the belly on the
<lb />bottom. You can give it some.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It can be molded hollow as for the body,
<lb />but the legs cannot. And to do it well, crayfish are already
<lb />fanciful enough to mold without looking for the hollow; this ought to be
<lb />reserved for turtles.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you open your mold, you
<lb />will find the crayfish with white bones, but not in
<lb />powder. And without opening it, the ☿ will have
<lb />done nothing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Layer these oil colors very
<lb />transparently.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To paint it, boil it with wine & a
<lb />little salt, in order that they become very red, & take this as
<lb />a model. Paint the back with vermilion mixed with lake,
<lb />& the sides & underneath the belly & the legs with
<lb />vermilion, & yellow ocher, and white.
</ab>
<ab>

<pb facs="#f281" />

<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having therefore let your crayfish dry a little in the
<lb />sun or on its own, if it has eggs, they will shrink while drying
<lb />and will only be more beautiful. Therefore, make your slab of
<lb />yellow potter’s earth, like for other figures,
<lb />lay your crayfish on top, the <-s-> back
<lb /><-on top-> on the bottom, & the legs, belly &
<lb />eggs, which are all the most fanciful parts to mold, on the other side
<lb />and on the top. Push the back down in the clay slab,
<lb />up to near the legs, which is about halfway. And fix the body with an
<lb />iron wire point in the middle &, if it seems
<lb />necessary, another at the end of the tail. And in order that the
<lb />big legs show themselves lower than the head, which is
<lb /><-enf-> half sunken, extend them &, from
<lb />underneath, add to them a little clay to raise them. Hide also the
<lb />horns in the clay, under the big legs, to arrange them afterward
<lb />as you like. As for the small legs, extend them on the clay
<lb />until the joint, and the other half of the legs remain above, curved,
<lb />for the first cast. However, in order that they do not move &
<lb />detach, secure them well, not only on the clay, but
<lb /><-att-> fix them with wax & a little hot
<lb />iron right in the joints. And if you want to find the
<lb />most fanciful cast, you can attach the end of one of the legs with the
<lb />same wax on the body, or on one of the big legs, and also make, if
<lb />it has eggs, the tail to be half folded on the eggs, & fix it in
<lb />this form with an iron wire point. Above all special heed,
<lb />since the thing is <-s-> thus arranged, that it can be
<lb />well cleaned. Lastly, having rubbed the crayfish with
<lb />eau-de-vie, cast your sand. Having set, uncover the back of the
<lb />crayfish, the head & the eyes & its little pincers, the
<lb />big legs, and the small legs all along, for one needs to uncover the most
<lb />that one can, both the long horns & the tail, except if you have
<lb />folded & curved it to hold the eggs. Other animals
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Secure what will  detach itself,
<lb />like the hairy brows near the mouth, with some melted
<lb />wax underneath.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Uncover the most that you can, but take
<lb />heed that the notching that you make in the mold will release
<lb />well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make the mold lean on the side
<lb />that will be the thickest of the animal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />To paint it, one does the middle of the
<lb />back <-mixed-> with vermilion mixed with a little
<lb />lake, and the sides & the belly & underneath the legs is
<lb />with a flesh color made of vermilion, white of ceruse, a
<lb />little yellow ocher. As in this & all other things, have
<lb />always the natural one in front of you to imitate it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lay the horns on the big legs,
<lb /><-&-> or make with whitened latten wire &
<lb />solder them.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take heed <-d-> when
<lb />modeling to arrange the legs in such a way that they do not pass the
<lb />belly of the crayfish, <-Aultr-> and that,
<lb />placing them, they sit well on the belly, otherwise the legs would
<lb />break from the weight of the body, which is massive.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f282" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />are not uncovered as much. But because the crayfish is
<lb />awkward to burn & clean, one needs to uncover as much as one can,
<lb />especially the little legs until the end, for these are awkward & if
<lb />they were not to be uncovered and you were to have to pull them, you
<lb />could break something in the mold. While uncovering with the
<lb />point of a knife, or even a burin or other appropriate
<lb />thing, clean very carefully the sand which will be in the joints
<lb />& elsewhere with your little brushes. And if something gets
<lb />detached, attach it with wax, as said. And attach also the horns
<lb />in the same way. And make also the gate, along the end of the little
<lb />legs, with some wax. And fill the holes made by the iron
<lb />wire point with it. And once everything is quite neat & more
<lb />than half is uncovered, oil your <-ut-> mold
<lb /><-& n’oubli->, after having dipped the reverse in
<lb />water, & do not forget to oil all the delicate parts
<lb />which are between the legs and the little pincers. Then, rub the
<lb />crayfish with eau-de-vie. And make your second cast,
<lb />having flattened the first mold, in order that the
<lb />clamps join better. Your mold must be wider on the
<lb />side that is imprinted than on the back. Do not open your mold
<lb />after the second cast unless it has been luted & reheated
<lb />& unless what is inside is burned. Do not forget to put
<lb />crocum among your sand when you mold crayfish,
<lb />for one needs to reheat strongly, & the crocum
<lb />withstands marvelously. Molding a crab & a
<lb />crayfish, it is all the same. When you have uncovered
<lb />your crayfish on one side, only delay making the second cast as little you can, for <-el-> crayfish dry
<lb /><-se-> out. It is not just about uncovering the
<lb />crayfish well, in such a way that you see an entire half, but
<lb />take heed that your mold itself, in which you uncover, releases
<lb />well, for even if the crayfish were well burned, you
<lb /><-despoui-> would not be able to open your mold
<lb />without breaking.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Repair with
<lb />penknives, <-[illegible]-> files, little
<lb />chaples, or burins, &c.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make all around them, as you see, a gate of wax, & at the end
<lb />of the tail, also two or three, from which you make the principal
<lb />gate.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make a gate of wax, elongated in
<lb />a line like a thick thread, all along the end of the legs &
<lb />at <-u-> the extremity of the tail. If there is also
<lb />some piece of leg or other part that is further away from the line of
<lb />the others, or raised above, or folded on its own, give it a gate of
<lb />wax, which from its extremity joins either at the body or at one
<lb />of the big legs or at some other place which receives a lot of
<lb />metal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having uncovered it, attach & secure
<lb />with wax the two little hairy horns of the crayfish
<lb />& other things which are not [<-en->]
<lb /><-despoui-> secured at all.

<lb />Molding grasshoppers and things too thin
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you have a written paper to mold that is too thin, after
<lb />you have made the first cast & it has set, give a little thickness
<lb />to the reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is
<lb />the most appropriate means there is, & for fortifying the wings of
<lb />either a butterfly or a grasshopper, or some delicate
<lb />part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to
<lb />apply this melted butter underneath the wing or in whichever
<lb />place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a pansy or
<lb />other flowers, butter is not good, but rather wheat
<lb />oil, which is soon dry & holds firm. Wax would not be
<lb />appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, & it makes the thing
<lb />to which it is applied contract. But butter is amiable and
<lb />handleable.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you write on paper or on

<lb />& press in.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+ Reheat your
<lb />molds with charcoals previously lit in the forge,

<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make the notches from those that enter more into the inside of the

<lb />this makes them <-melt-> break.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not keep them in a humid or
<lb />enclosed place if they are not quite dry [<-e->], for they go moldy. So do
<lb />dried animals.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to reheat molds
<lb />twice when the animal can be removed without burning, like a
<lb />toad, which can well be molded hollow like all thick animals.
<lb />However, it is always good to redden the mold once.

<ab>
<lb />Lute for luting your molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I have not found one that is made more quickly than this one, nor

<lb />it about half horse dung, & then have it

<lb />Molding turtles
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The water turtle is more beautiful to mold
<lb />because it has prettier scales & straight legs. And those of the
<lb />garrigue have crooked ones. They are of long
<lb />life; getting ready to put them to death, open their mouth & pass a long
<lb />penknife through all the intestines, & then make it swallow
<lb />some vinegar mixed with eau-de-vie or urine, as for
<lb />snakes. One needs to mold them in several pieces, & the
<lb />back itself, sometimes, because the sides for some are narrower than
<lb />elsewhere & are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one
<lb />ought not to boil them, for they come apart, & even the shell, from the
<lb />hot water. They come out better hollow, because their great
<lb />thickness corrupts the mold. Those from
<lb />water are more vigorous. Those of the
<lb />garrigue are thinner, slower & more
<lb />sleepy. If you scratch those of the water on their
<lb />shells, however sleepy they are, they move. Those of the 
<lb />garrigue do not.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They die rather quickly in
<lb />vinegar mixed with a little eau-de-vie or urine, as
<lb />with all other animals.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They keep themselves, in the
<lb />winter, with their eyes closed & are as dead, being
<lb />numbed by the cold. They hide in the earth or
<lb />under wheat chaff or warm manure, & live
<lb />only on the moisture of the earth.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to mold them as soon as they are dead because they are still too
<lb />stiff. But on the following day, you will manipulate them &
<lb />fold their legs as you wish.

<lb />Molders from Foix

<lb />come to join one with the other by means of the said gates,
<lb />which you will start in the round parts, empty of wax, that you
<lb />have put at the end of the feet to attract the metal. Thus, the
<lb />gate being made by wax, you are in no danger of encrusting
<lb />something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make
<lb />thus the gate of wax, to cast the second mold on top, than to
<lb />wait to do them after the mold is
<lb />reheated <-q->, for at that point, it is necessary, if
<lb />possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well & evenly

<lb />that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in

<lb />Turtles
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Those of water are more beautiful & easier
<lb />to mold <-than those->, being flatter & having a longer head
<lb />& tail <-q-> and legs straighter & better to
<lb />release than those of the garrigue, which
<lb />are lean, wrinkled & well ensconced in their shell, which also have
<lb />a rounder top of the shell & nevertheless narrower <-v->
<lb />on the sides than near the middle, which is the reason their
<lb /><-l-> top shell cannot be molded well in one piece like
<lb />those of the water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />When they are better mortified & rested two or three
<lb />days, they bend and are handled better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> <-Therefore-> Thus, you
<lb />will mold their top shell in two pieces, the bottom ones in two or three
<lb />or four, according to the need. But, note that if you want to release
<lb />your turtle from the mold without burning it, it needs
<lb />to be molded thus in several pieces. But, if you want it to be burned
<lb /><-p-> inside, you can mold the top shell in one piece.
<lb />Therefore, to put your hand to the work after you have killed it entirely
<lb />in vinegar & urine, as said, let it dry well. And
<lb />clean it well with your small bristle brushes. Next, <-not-> take your
<lb />clay slab and put it on top and smudge it a little, in order
<lb />that the bottom shell fastens to it, having, nevertheless, earlier
<lb />shaped the head with a strong point, as with other animals,
<lb />making it hold high by the means of <-one-> a little fresh
<lb />clay that you will adapt from underneath. Stretch the said
<lb />head & legs with your little pincers. The head arranged,
<lb />dexterously place <-d-> a grain of yellow
<lb />millet in each eye with pincers, because as soon as
<lb />they are dead the eyes are burst and putrid. You can do this as well
<lb />with all other small animals, with some grain of large
<lb />amaranth, some of small, and grain of
<lb />rapeseed, & this done, you will arrange the legs,
<lb />securing them with iron points and then, with some
<lb />clay, fill up all the empty space around the turtle,
<lb />that is to say what is between the two shells, in order that the sand
<lb />entering there does not prevent it from releasing. And because the legs
<lb />should be lower than the shell of the <-s->
<lb /><-e-> <-of-> belly, make a little pit in the
<lb />clay slab to adapt them there. Your turtle

<lb />having been thus arranged & well cleaned with

<lb />clay around the slab. Then, with a band of
<lb />clay placed on the middle of <-e-> the
<lb /><-the-> back of the turtle, as you see, & at the
<lb />widest place, divide your mold. Subsequently, oil with
<lb />your paintbrush dedicated for this the half of the shell
<lb />you want to mold. Temper in hot water, so that without burning
<lb />yourself, you can hold your finger in it without
<lb />burning yourself, your sand, a little <-p-> thick.
<lb />And <-f-> before casting it, rub the shell with
<lb />eau-de-vie. And next, cast your sand & let it set, and note
<lb />that all things that have shells or that are hard or are not
<lb />malleable, like snakes & lizards, want to be
<lb />oiled to release. Things that are malleable do not need this.
<lb />Hot water makes the tempered sand <-in water-> set
<lb />better on oil, which otherwise would be refused.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb /> Once your half of the
<lb />turtle is thus <-desp-> molded,
<lb />separate it, with its half mold, from the clay
<lb />slab that you will set aside to return it to when it is necessary.
<lb />Next, clean your half mold & smooth it & flatten, like
<lb />the others. But because it happens that because <-u-> of
<lb />the clay entredeux, the half mold will consist
<lb />of more than half of the turtle, cut & pare down smoothly
<lb />the excess, & clean everything well with brushes. Then,
<lb />make on the top edge of the mold, on the side that is cut &
<lb />halfway, two notches, like for other molds, and return your
<lb />turtle to its slab as it was, & secure its two
<lb />legs, which are not molded, with iron wire points. And
<lb />stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell, with
<lb />clay. Next, place the circle around and put a
<lb />clay entredeulx on the first mold, a little
<lb />above the notches. And having oiled the <-d->
<lb />first half mold, & its notches, and the shell of the
<lb />turtle, & having also showered it with eau-de-vie,
<lb />heat your water, temper you sand with a little sal
<lb />ammoniac water & the said hot water, & cast. Having set,
<lb />adapt the sides of these two molds smoothly, & on each side
<lb />secure their joint, which can only just be perceived, with two
<lb />clamps, in order that when uncovering afterward the underneath
<lb />of the turtle, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of
<lb />the belly & of the throat, in the way that you uncover a
<lb />crayfish, which is the most difficult to mold of the little
<lb />beasts, which are molded in two halves.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can mold the turtle with one piece for each side, but one
<lb />would need to burn it. And afterward, to make the hollow, the reheated

<lb />Cuttlefish bone
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One ought not to cast either tin or lead too hot in it, for
<lb />it would burn the bone & come out lumpy. And to
<lb />know when it is at a good heat, dip a little piece of twisted
<lb />paper into it. If it blackens it without lighting, it is at
<lb />a good heat. But if it burns it & catches fire there, it is too
<lb />hot. Gold & silver are able to be cast well
<lb />there, but it never comes out very neat. To mold something delicate
<lb />well, it is necessary that the bone be not so dry
<lb /><-If->, for it is brittle & does not release as neatly &
<lb />crumbles & flakes. However, before casting in them, dry them, &
<lb />especially for gold, which does not want humidity. You will
<lb />recognize that they are dry enough when, after having brought the inside
<lb />& the imprint of these to the fire, they cry & crackle once
<lb />brought near the ear. Then, join them &
<lb />lute the joints with a little clay, & make it dry
<lb />lightly by the fire, & cast, & then shake the mold or
<lb />scratch over rough scales, & let it cool before opening. Usually one
<lb />cuts the bone in the middle, and the dullest part and
<lb />that which does not have any half circles
<lb />    
<lb />is the most delicate and smoothest for molding, & thus one always
<lb />imprints there the principal; the other is scaly on the inside, as it
<lb />demonstrates on the outside. Thus, one does not use this for delicate
<lb />things that are molded on two sides. One smooths & flattens these
<lb />two halves on some smooth wood, then one scrapes
<lb />charcoal on top to make it release well. And to make the
<lb />charcoal run evenly everywhere, one knocks on the side of the
<lb />hand that holds half of the bone. Once both
<lb />charcoaled, one takes the main bone that is
<lb />prepared & rounded on the sides, and having set the medal on top,
<lb />one tightens and presses it quite strongly.

<lb />But <-because-> the fingers do not press
<lb />evenly, for <-one-> if you press on the edges, the middle will
<lb />remain hollow. Begin, therefore, by the middle, & then follow the
<lb />edges. But to make it better, put on the medal something flat &
<lb />smooth, or some large square file <-e->, & press with
<lb />this, for you will press equally, sometimes <-after l->
<lb />with your knee, other times with your
<lb />foot with your shoe taken off, & make the
<lb />bone be on top; thus you <-l’emprand->
<lb />will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
<lb />molded well, return to it several times. Then, repair & smooth on the
<lb />sides your <-d-> halves of molded bone.
<lb /><-&-> And to cut it well, always begin coming from the
<lb />softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
<lb />itself, scratch the bone from the back, which is rugged,
<lb />and it will release. When you want to cast, secure & join your two
<lb />bones with some small points of wood,
<lb />&c. But to mold very neatly, there is only our sand.

<lb />strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
<lb />burst, the sand being inside. Secure it & fortify it well by the
<lb />foot, & join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
<lb />& securely adapted to the end <-of
<lb />cir-> of the gate of wax, which should not be rough
<lb />but rather smooth, in order that it can release well. Then, wet your

<lb />in order that it gets wet everywhere; if not, wet it with a
<lb />large paintbrush dedicated to this. Then, pass through
<lb />the end of the mold which closes the circle your bit
<lb />of iron wire, which holds the wax gate, and
<lb />cleave with it the clay closure, as you see, &
<lb /><-it-> place it low, so that the plant or flower touches no
<lb />thing & can leave enough thickness for the mold, for the
<lb />tempered sand always raises the plant or flower. Thus, if it is not stiff by
<lb />itself, pass with a needle some thin thread
<lb /><-po-> on the flower to keep it from rising. Or, if you
<lb />were to forget, lower the flower with some
<lb /><-b-> small stick until the cast sand begins to
<lb /><-d-> thicken. Your flower being well arranged,
<lb /><-d-> choose a bowl big enough to temper in it as
<lb />much sand as it takes to fill your mold. Put in a little sal
<lb />ammoniac water, then some fountain water. And when
<lb />the <-au en-> bowl is nearly full, put in, by
<lb />sprinkling, your sand, & mix & dilute it well in order that it
<lb />all becomes smooth, for if it were to coagulate, it would spoil the
<lb />mold. For flowers, it does not want to be so thick, and
<lb />especially at the beginning, you will throw, in thrusts, the clearest one
<lb />on the flower, & when it will be half covered, blow strongly
<lb />everywhere, to make the little bubbles disappear. Next, finish filling
<lb />& blow always. Make the mold lean a little toward its
<lb />widest part, and if you find the remains of thick sand, which has not
<lb />thinned well, cast it rather toward the gate than elsewhere. Finally,
<lb />you can even cast some thicker tempered sand in order to make [<-make->] a quicker set.
<lb />I have molded thus a marigold with its leaves. The
<lb />crocum ferri is safer for flowers, and when there is
<lb />crocum, lute with the same sand that has served, and
<lb />is the most excellent of all.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The alloy with which I cast a large branch of marigold, which came out neatly like the natural
<lb />with its flower, its buds, and its leaves, was of one lb of fine tin mixed with two
<lb />ounces of lead.

<ab>
<lb />If there is some flashing, repair with a penknife.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Uncover the molded flower by gently undoing the mold with the
<lb />point of a knife, & better yet, wet it well in
<lb />water. Next, use small hog bristle brushes,
<lb />a bit of iron wire, &c. When the mold is
<lb />reheated the first time, leave it to half cool, then gently pass through
<lb />the gate an iron wire to make an opening for the burned
<lb />ashes inside. Next, blow inside with bellows, then
<lb />turn the mold at the gate to make everything come out, &
<lb />sometimes suck and draw out with the mouth.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take heed not to attach the tail of the flower too much to the gate of
<lb />wax, for fear of spoiling something when you pull out the gate of
<lb />wax. To pull it out, one needs to dig out all around a little,

<lb />This is the continuation of the second preceding leaf. When you have
<lb />well uncovered the part of the belly of the turtle, the
<lb />underneath of the throat & of the legs, & having cleaned it all well,
<lb />do not forget to neatly uncover this cavity that these animals have in
<lb />their shell between the neck & the shoulders. Those of the
<lb />water do not have ones as deep as those of the
<lb />garrigue, which are leaner. And among
<lb />these, there are some that have ones more ensconced than others. Do not
<lb />forget, therefore, to uncover all of this well to better represent its
<lb />nature. But if there is some cavity which twists too much inside and
<lb />can neither be seen nor released,
<lb />    
<lb /> put in some small pieces of wax,
<lb />& with points of hot, thick iron wire, stretch &
<lb />adapt the said wax. Then, <-bouch-> stuff with
<lb />soft clay the entrance of all its cavities. Put the
<lb />clay circle around your mold, made already of
<lb />two pieces, which contains the back of the turtle. And to mold
<lb />its belly, one needs to divide in three, as you see. That is to say, you
<lb />will put an entre deulx of clay on top of the
<lb />throat & another on the edge of the shell of the tail,
<lb />#. And having oiled <-and-> the shell of
<lb />the belly & having rubbed it with eau-de-vie, cast your sand
<lb />a little thick, & temper with hot water as before. Having set,
<lb />remove these entredeulx of clay, then uncover
<lb />well the front & back legs, that is to say the part underneath &
<lb />the tail & the throat, & remove the clay from the cavities
<lb /><-qu->, all in one piece if you can, for this will show
<lb />you if this cavity will release well. And if the pulled-out clay brings with it the wax that you put there, put back it in the places
<lb />that cannot release, as is said. And if some part is taken away or let
<lb />go, attach & rejoin it to the mold with some wax
<lb />& the point of hot iron. Do not forget to put some
<lb /><-po-> melted wax at the end of the nails of the
<lb />turtles to make the vent. Your belly shell molded and uncovered,
<lb />your mold can be seen thus.

<ab>
<lb />in such a way that only the entire belly shell be uncovered, to mold it

<pb facs="#f292" />

<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take heed to make a border of melted wax, with a hot
<lb />iron, all around the edge of the top shell which is toward
<lb />the tail, in order the make the vent better. And make two little
<lb />strings of the same wax, <-r-> connecting from
<lb />the end the belly shell to the said edge of wax that is around
<lb />the shell of the spine, and make sure that <-turtle of->
<lb />the tail of the turtle stays between these two strings. This is
<lb />to make the vent better. This done,
<lb />oil your mold and what appears of the shell. Put the
<lb />circle around & cast with hot water, as before,
<lb />observing there what you have observed. Do the same to mold the third
<lb />part, which is the tail. And having set, <-You-> <-Uncover
<lb />your mold-> remove the clay contour, clean your
<lb />mold, & smooth it & flatten it on all sides with a
<lb />knife, like for other molds. Dip it lightly in
<lb />water, then try to release it. Usually one begins
<lb /><-ment-> with <-e-> <-back-> the
<lb />back shell, <-it is-> that is to say, the mold on top,
<lb />which is in two halves, and this one is easier to release. The other one
<lb />follows after, but because it is neighboring the shoulder of the
<lb />turtles, which are deeply ensconced, it is sometimes awkward.
<lb />Thus, when moving & pulling the mold gently, take heed to
<lb />pull the one which will present itself as the easiest, for one needs to
<lb />release one after the other. The most awkward of all is the one which
<lb />molds the <-e-> <-of-> throat, the
<lb />underneaths of the legs & the hollow shoulder pieces, which are of
<lb />such bad release that if you had not provided for it, by filling with
<lb />wax before molding what does not release well, it will be awkward
<lb />for you to pull your pieces out without breaking something. But should
<lb />this happen to you, there is still a remedy, provided that you keep
<lb /><-pi-> the broken pieces.
<lb />    
<lb /> For you can reassemble them
<lb />with points of rather strong iron & fill the crack
<lb />or fault that could be there with melted wax & the hot
<lb />iron, as with others, in order that the core for molding
<lb />hollow is made better. Next

<lb />pure. I cast it in its very red mold. It came out very neat
<lb />& thin like paper, & hollow on the reverse. But because
<lb />it had crusted, I reheated it, that is to say

<lb />Molding turtles
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Next, reassemble the parts of your mold and clamp
<lb />carefully all the joints, as much as above & below as on the sides,
<lb />having not forgotten to notch the joints of the molds, as with
<lb />others. Having clamped it all, undo the clamps on the
<lb />side & not the others. And thus, your mold of several
<lb />pieces <-sem-> will open as if it were only in two
<lb />halves. If you want to mold hollow, make in the middle of the <-of
<lb />the part-> mold of the belly a hole, from side to side,
<lb />which, inside, is of such capacity that the end of a little
<lb />finger can almost enter it, widening like a clervoise
<lb />the outside of the hole. This is to cast the core. But note
<lb />that all these difficulties would be nothing if you wanted
<lb />to mold hollow, because you could mold your turtle in two pieces
<lb /><-[illegible]-> and burn it inside, as with other animals, and it
<lb />would be done quickly. But since the turtle is massive & 
<lb />would be weighty if it is not hollow, one considers it better molded in
<lb />this way hollow, and in <-cha-> this fashion, to
<lb />make a mold well, one really needs three
<lb />days. Take heed in hollow & fanciful
<lb />molds to have some strong plaster, which endures the
<lb />fire without bursting, if it is possible. But if you cannot have any
<lb />such, mix a little more feather alum & add to it
<lb />also some crocum, which fortifies it & makes it so that the
<lb />flashing, if there is any, comes out so finely that it is easily undone.
<lb />Also, do not forget to tighten your molds well with a press to avoid flashing which is made either when the
<lb />mold is not well joined or when it bursts. To repair, if the
<lb />features are not apparent enough, retrace them lightly with a
<lb />burin, then soften them with a small chisel. The flashing
<lb />is removed with the chaple, a type of
<lb />burin. For the lumps & scales, they are made either with a
<lb />little gouge or a little round cutting-punch, or with
<lb />the point of a small chisel, not tempered, & struck on a
<lb />small file.

<lb />Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it,

<lb />Molding a fly
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Large flies can be molded & <-g-> made
<lb />by casting. But one needs <-par d-> to anoint underneath
<lb />their wings with wheat oil, which dries quickly and
<lb />fortifies them & gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
<lb />butterflies, cicadas, grasshoppers &
<lb />similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
<lb />leaf or bouquet. The others are made by hand with a very
<lb />thin silver sheet. One ought not to keep them once dead,
<lb />because they dry out and their legs break.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Wheat oil is put underneath delicate things to render
<lb />them more rigid & firm & to make them hold their natural
<lb />position. Because being weak & delicate, the tempered sand, weighing down
<lb />their tops, would change their form.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Bat
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They have very thin wings, & if they are large & dry and
<lb />their wings extended, one would need a very large mold & it
<lb />would not be certain that the metal would run sufficiently. Thus,
<lb />when you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones & make the
<lb />pose <-qu-> so that they have their wings half folded. Because in
<lb />this way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings
<lb />with wax, as you know, to feed the cast well.

<lb />tin and two ℥ of fine lead.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For lizards that are as thick as one or two

<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They are less subject to cracking while reheating when they are very
<lb />thick, rather than when they are of little thickness, provided that
<lb />the thickness is sufficient. For being thin, they scarcely need to be
<lb /><-recui-> on the fire, & a long time on the fire
<lb />makes them corrupt, especially when the plaster is not
<lb />strong.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is better to reheat a mold on its own than several
<lb />together, because one needs a larger & more violent fire for several
<lb />than for one. And, glowing charcoal stopping up the space between
<lb />the molds, the heat reverberates from one to the other in such
<lb />a way that more often you will find your molds burst &
<lb />cracked on one side more than another.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Therefore reheat your molds alone, not making fire there,
<lb />except to cover it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And because your lead and tin become sour when
<lb />frequently melted red, to soften, melt it without reddening, and
<lb />cast in a rod.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Brick cools the metal, & if this were not for giving

<ab>
<lb />Molding hollow
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This iron wire point, which is put thus
<lb /><-bi-> through the hole, is to better hold the 
<lb />core & keep it from shifting. All of this being
<lb /><-d-> thus arranged, lay your mold on the
<lb />table, the hole at the top, as it is marked here on the side,
<lb />& then adapt a circle of soft clay
<lb /><-aultr->, two fingers high, around
<lb />the hole, like for other molds. And then temper your molding sand
<lb />moderately thick, & cast it through the hole until it is well [<-well->]
<lb />filled, up to the surface of the clay circle. But take
<lb />heed to not cast <-r-> in through the middle of the
<lb />hole, but rather from the side, for, since the already made
<lb />mold drinks and sucks the moisture <-of the new->, the
<lb />new one that you cast in <-which dries quickly-> on the edge of
<lb />the mold, being quickly dry, <-s-> would
<lb />obstruct the mold, & it would not finish filling. And when
<lb />you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can
<lb />clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the <-f->
<lb />[<-the->] wet gate, & put the
<lb />end of your finger in the hole a few times, <-po->
<lb />or some small point, to unblock it, & make the hollow
<lb />wax fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand, tempered a little
<lb />thick to give strength to the mold, for water coming
<lb />to the surface <-s-> of the mold
<lb />always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the clay
<lb />circle & the excess which is on the hole through which you
<lb />cast the noyau, & nothing will be discernable. When your
<lb />mold is thus prepared, lute it all around with the
<lb />same sand which served for the molds. Next, reheat it in a slow
<lb />fire at the beginning, & the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in
<lb />order that the wax flows out gently. For if you were
<lb />to give it great heat until the wax came out, it would boil
<lb />inside & leave some pustules & lumpy things, although
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This point is placed in the middle & through the hole of
<lb />the gate when the mold is in several pieces, like a
<lb />turtle, and this is done in order that the core does
<lb />not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces,
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />it is not necessary to put points in the middle of it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Before casting the core, make some notches all around the hole
<lb />through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the
<lb />mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Mixed tallow is the reason that, when emptying the wax,
<lb />the hole does not become obstructed. One needs half
<lb />tallow & half black wax.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of
<lb />mostly lead remains hot a long time & eats the
<lb />mold.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can, after the cast is done, mold <-a-> the part of the shell
<lb />of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural
<lb />one, and reattach it with
<lb />solder.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />X Note that, after your
<lb />core is cast, it is
<lb />better to put the mold
<lb />in hot water to open it, in order
<lb />to remove the most wax that you can, always softening
<lb /><-a-> it in hot water. For the less wax
<lb />that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling in large quantity in
<lb />the mold when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in
<lb />it. And then, if there is hardly any wax, you will not need to
<lb />reheat it as much. When opening the mold, the cast will break.
<lb />But it can easily be repaired, even though you
<lb />cast A

<lb />the white wax with which you have composed your black
<lb />sulfured wax, has such little substance, since being dry and
<lb />purified, that it leaves nothing inside, and flows very gently. As for
<lb />the charcoal which is mixed in, if some remains, it burns &
<lb />reduces to ash & is emptied afterward by blowing through
<lb />the gate. You could even open your mold after the wax
<lb />has melted, if there is no fanciful thing which could break, like some
<lb />reattached thing or similar. After having covered the clamps
<lb />with the lute from your sand & having covered all of the
<lb />mold, give it on top a layer of common lute, & then
<lb />sprinkle this with some pestled brick, in order that you can
<lb />handle it better. Let the lute dry slowly before firing it,
<lb />which melts the wax. The wax having left through the gate,
<lb />that which remains with the charcoal will burn. Being reheated
<lb />for the first time, lute it <-pou-> once more,
<lb /><-to reheat it the second time-> because the plaster, not
<lb />being good, will have readily made the mold retract, and the
<lb />joints will crack open, which might make large flashing. And for the second
<lb />time, one ought not to reheat it if you only want to cast in
<lb />lead or tin, but rather only make sure that the
<lb />lute is quite dry & the mold moderately hot. For
<lb />these turtles that have a large size & enough thickness, it
<lb />is better to <-mold ault-> cast <-your
<lb />lead-> an alloy half of lead &
<lb />half of tin, especially for hollow things. For, if you
<lb />only have very thin & very weak things to cast, like flowers, rely
<lb />rather on the abundance of lead than of tin, which becomes
<lb />porous once cast a little thick, & readily makes some flaw around
<lb />the cast. Maistre Alexandre says that he has never gone wrong
<lb />with half tin & half lead for things
<lb />weighty & with the thickness of the back of a
<lb />knife. If there is crocum, the joints hardly
<lb />appear, & consequently, the flashing is very small & thin. You can
<lb />repair & through the hole of the belly, pull the earth of the
<lb />core, leaving it wet a long time;
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have cast your black wax in the <-a->
<lb />mold, & when it is quite cold, you need to <-the->
<lb />open your mold halfway, to make the cast. And if the
<lb />figure of black wax breaks, there is no danger, for it
<lb />can always be reattached with a hot iron <-touching->
<lb />point. Or else, if the pieces are not separated from the
<lb />mold, <-qu-> they meet up & join like
<lb />beforehand by joining & binding well the two halves of the
<lb />mold. When the figure is large, one needs to cross

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />in order that the

<lb />own by keeping the mold leaning toward the gate when
<lb />reheating it. And when the mold is reheated, leave it to cool
<lb />gently, then blow inside, and draw toward yourself, while sucking, in
<lb />order that the ashes of the wax come out. Do this with

<lb />however, do not remove it until you have completely repaired the
<lb />turtle, for you will use this earth as cement if
<lb />you need to embed something or repair with the small chisel. If
<lb />there is some flashing at the joints of the mold, you will remove
<lb />it, either with the burin called a
<lb />chaple or a very sharp penknife,
<lb />or with a small file, & then with the small
<lb />chisel, always having the natural one, to do this better, in
<lb />front of you. You can curl on a file the point of a small
<lb />chisel which is not quenched to make something lumpy. For these
<lb /><-two-> turtles & hollow things that
<lb />presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of half
<lb />lead & half fine tin. There is more work in
<lb />molding a turtle than for twelve molds of flowers. If
<lb />there is some crocum in your sand, there will not be
<lb />flashing, & if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be
<lb />thinner than paper, as long as your mold is tightened
<lb />well with a press.
<lb />    
<lb />    
<lb /> And to make the scales of turtles
<lb />or other animals, you can make some little small chisels in
<lb />the fashion of a round cutting-punch, others in the fashion of a
<lb />gouge or the scale of a snake & lizard,
<lb />and others on a file to make the curly & lumpy bits. The
<lb />turtles which are not molded hollow do not have as much work,
<lb />for they are molded in two pieces, to repair them with small
<lb />chisels, small cutting-punches, small gouges
<lb />& small serrated chisels.

<lb />Wheat oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to make it between two quite sparkling hot iron

<lb />which you will put some wheat, quite even & uniform.
<lb />And then you will place the other, all red, on top, & you will press
<lb />it until you see the black oil drip well. Reiterate that until
<lb />you have enough of it. This oil dries immediately. It gives gold
<lb />color to silvered & burnished things, augments the color of
<lb />gilded things, serves as a varnish on iron for
<lb />engraving on it afterward, for varnishing sword guards tawny. And could
<lb />also serve makers of gilded leather well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to use it when it is newly
<lb />made. And for things to be molded, it must not be as thick as for
<lb />coloring.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is not for anointing hairy animals,
<lb />for it is too strong & stiff, but it is good to give form to the

<lb />Molding a rat
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The hairs of its whiskers would be awkward to come out in the
<lb />cast; you can therefore shave them with fire, like <-d->
<lb />the tyrant of Syracuse,
<lb />& afterward you can replace them with <-d’arg-> natural silvered ones. The tail is beautiful molded because it
<lb />is made of scaly circles, nearly like the one of a lizard,
<lb />& in order that the hair does not hinder good molding, burn it in
<lb />the fire of a little candle. The rest of the body should be
<lb />anointed with wheat oil, which will keep the hair stiff
<lb />& couched, so that the sand will not raise it by getting entangled
<lb />in it to prevent coming out neatly. The wheat oil being
<lb />dry, which will be quick, you will be able to pass a very thin
<lb />comb to divide it, in order that it appears in the cast. On a
<lb />small mouse, you can even put some common oil to lower
<lb />the hair. And before molding these animals (except snakes &
<lb />lizards), let them <-rest-> remain dead one or two
<lb />days to have them more handleable. For they stay rigid
<lb />after their death & cannot be well fitted to their true shape until
<lb />they are a little softened. However, if you mold it quickly after it is
<lb />dead, or give it its shape before it stiffens, you will do well.
<lb /><-Au-> And because the eyes die, <-you in it
<lb />en-> if you do not mold it promptly, you will be able to
<lb />substitute in the eyes the halves of well-rounded
<lb />peas, stripped of their skin & shell. Some make the
<lb />rat shed, others anoint it with olive
<lb />oil, which is amiable, for wheat oil is thick &
<lb />has too much body. This is why one scarcely uses it, only to give some
<lb />feature to a fly foot or under a wing to keep them rigid.
<lb />Others couch the hair with an egg yolk, which is
<lb />quickly dry & amiable. Shape it, before oiling it, on the
<lb />clay slab, and raise its head with an iron
<lb />point, & secure also the feet with points, & the tail. Rub it
<lb />with eau-de-vie, once dry from the oil. Then, cast your
<lb />sand; next, uncover it like other animals, & make the second cast.
<lb />One ought not to open the mold until it is reheated & the
<lb />rat burned.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The rat, because it is thick, comes out better being hollow if
<lb />it is a big rat. A mouse molds better, because it has
<lb />shorter hair. It is not possible to mold well an animal that has
<lb />biggish bones, like a bird or rat, without
<lb />opening the mold to clean it well, for bones do not
<lb />calcine.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />All feathers & all hair is awkward
<lb />to mold according to its nature.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Butter for anointing hairy animals
<lb />is better <-e-> than wheat oil, because
<lb />it is more amiable.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If the rat is big, it is good
<lb />to remove its entrails, or, having molded it, to dry it in the
<lb />oven, because the large amount of humidity that it has comes to
<lb />boil in the mold, & spoils it & makes it lumpy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Do not put your mold in
<lb />the cold until it has slowly cooled dry. Otherwise it imbibes the
<lb />humidity, which makes it break.

<ab>
<lb />Repairing cast things
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It happens often that what you have cast makes flashing, either through
<lb />fault in the mold, or from the cast, or from the metal.
<lb />The fault in the mold comes from plaster, which is not
<lb />hard & strong and does not withstand fire (which is corrected by
<lb />mixing it with crocum). Usually as well, if there is an
<lb />imperfection, it is from the cast. If there is also too much tin
<lb />in a moderately thick thing, it does not come out well, because
<lb />tin cast thick retracts & becomes porous. Also, things
<lb />molded hollow are fanciful to cast. If, therefore, some flaw should
<lb />happen, take a leather cushionet full of fine sand,
<lb />& having placed it on the bequet of the
<lb />goldsmith’s table, where one files, place
<lb />your work on it & secure it with a rope which passes
<lb />under your foot. The sand in the bag
<lb />obeys & arranges itself by and by, thick on one side & thin on
<lb />the other. Then, forthwith, with a burin, make & trace
<lb />roughly the fine lines which were omitted or which are not apparent
<lb />enough, or with a file or a chaple, remove
<lb />the flashing. And if there is some fault in the substance, which left some
<lb />pit or too-hollow thing, rescrape this with a burin and
<lb />notch around the edge, then imprint this with some wax. And place
<lb />the imprint on a delicate plate of lead, & mark
<lb />thus the appropriate measure of lead or of the alloy similar to
<lb />your substance, then place the piece of the notched thing & attach
<lb />it well with some latten wire, then rub the edge with
<lb />rosin if it is tin or lead & place all around
<lb />some small thin pieces of solder or tin or other things,
<lb />then with a hot iron or in the fire of the
<lb />forge, solder, and next repair this with the aforesaid
<lb />tools & with the appropriate small chisels.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For gold & small work, one needs to cement it on a ball of
<lb />lead, which will be placed on the cushionet & will
<lb />be held thus with the rope.

<lb />with some wax on the relief of lead, & you will
<lb />have a very neat hollow form in the wax, which comes out very neatly
<lb />on the lead. Next, in the hollow form of wax, cast your tempered sand, which will make for you a relief, on which you will cast your
<lb />hollow form in silver or another metal for seals. But note
<lb />that you should not make your hollow form with melted wax, but rather,
<lb />only heated in warm water, or, even better, in warm
<lb />urine. Or else, if you have a relief of gold or
<lb />silver, or other metal, very <-faço-> neat
<lb />& repaired, imprint on top your hollow form of wax, & then in
<lb />the latter, cast your sand, which will come out in relief, on which you will next cast your hollow form for seals or other works. You could even
<lb />cast a hollow form on the principal of metal relief, &
<lb />even with lead & tin, which will not melt the
<lb />principal if it is lightly anointed with crushed chalk with a paintbrush, or smoked with candle smoke or with
<lb />dried glair of egg.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you have imprinted your seal of
<lb />wax, mold en noyau this piece of wax, which is
<lb />hollow, like your seal, & your noyau will render it molded,
<lb />similar to <-u-> the imprint & the seal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is necessary that your wax be mixed with some color which
<lb />hardly has body in order that you see the imprint better. Lamp
<lb />smoke or soot black is good for this. White wax, for
<lb />this effect, is <-exc-> better.

<lb />Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having cast your first mold, mix [illegible]
<lb />crocum or well-ground iron scales to firm it up.
<lb />And having set & rendered your hollow form very neat, take some
<lb />paste of fine

<ab>
<lb />flour. And to flatten it, take a small stick of
<lb />boxwood, very round & of the same thickness
<lb />everywhere, which has, at the two ends, a little circle, more raised
<lb />than the rest, to give the necessary thickness to the paste. And
<lb />then, with this rolling pin, flatten it in such a way that it
<lb />is delicate & thin enough. Then apply it on the hollow
<lb />of your mold and press on it with some cotton
<lb />& your figure will imprint itself in the paste, in relief on
<lb />one side & in a hollow form on the other. This done, anoint with a
<lb />paintbrush, wetted in a little melted butter, the
<lb />part of the paste which is hollow. Then, cut the
<lb />excess [<-r->] paste which surpasses the hollow of the
<lb />mold <-H->. Anoint your mold also with
<lb />olive oil, as you have done with others, place the
<lb />clay contour & cast <-s-> your
<lb />second mold. And you will have your medal as thin & hollow on one
<lb />side as you will want. You can have diverse rolling pins, which will
<lb />have ends, some more raised than others, to make various thicknesses, or
<lb />use sheets of lead & copper of various thicknesses
<lb />or of carton, cut with the rolling
<lb />pin.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you were to rub your paste with oil, it would drink the
<lb />oil & penetrate up to the mold, which it would
<lb />attack. But butter remains on the surface of the paste
<lb />& is not imbibed at all. You should not, on these reverse sides,
<lb />temper your sand with hot water, for it would melt

<lb /> the butter.

<lb />Testing the goodness and strength of a sand to be reheated
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />After it has set, it must be found smooth & easy to cut, and not

<lb />in a small one, for the large one remains long in the fire & the
<lb />small one is soon reheated.

<lb />Gold as gilding goes away once the piece is reheated &

<lb />Softening silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When goldsmiths who work large wares have
<lb />forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
<lb />it bursts & cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
<lb />when it is well melted, some dry mortar composed of sand &
<lb />good lime which has been worked, & pulverize it & throw
<lb />it in.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Goldsmiths do not work at all with
<lb />the silver from reals that is not alloyed, because it is
<lb />leady & when forging it sours.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some solder, for small works & things which only go in the fire
<lb />once, with some old sou & carolus, reheated & beaten. 
<lb />However, if the sou is not very
<lb />good, the solder eats away & one needs to solder there twice,
<lb />& one finds there too much copper. Others solder with
<lb />half silver & half fine copper.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Iron scales
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once well pulverized & ground on marble, &
<lb />mixed with the aforesaid sand of noyau, and dried slowly
<lb />without reheating, it endures several casts of lead &
<lb />tin. Copper & latten come out well. But if it
<lb />is not well ground, like crocum, it goes to the bottom,
<lb />if the sand is not tempered thickly enough.

<lb />Metal filings
</ab>

<lb />They are not made by themselves if they are not aided by some

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is very capricious to cast. It must be cast very hot. And to better
<lb />achieve your goal, throw on it some sal ammoniac to thin it. Alloy
<lb />it as well with a little red copper and, when you want to cast, a
<lb />little tin to make it run better. It always leaves a tail like
<lb />melted glass. It does not require as long a gate as

<ab>
<lb />Molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is only good that it die down a little on the outside &

<lb />the air & vehement exhalations of fire do not receive the cast so
<lb />well.

<ab>
<lb />Casting of silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Silver needs a longish gate. For gold it does not
<lb />matter. Silver, when soldering, tolerates the water
<lb />one throws on it. But gold would spatter, & <-needs
<lb />that-> for that reason, one casts <-solder->
<lb />bran on the solder.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Let the mold cool well after the casting before opening

<ab>
<lb />Reinforcing flowers and delicate things
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For flowers & <-delicate things->
<lb />[<-&->] herbage, one does not use wheat oil but melted
<lb />butter, of which one gives a light # coat
<lb /> on the back of the petals of the
<lb />rose flower & the pansy & other flowers that
<lb />need it. But one reinforces the <-f-> little legs of flies &
<lb />other small animals with wheat oil to strengthen them
<lb />& make them hold up.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />with a small paintbrush
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Strawberries
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The leaves are cast separately & then are joined with
<lb />solder. And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid,
<lb />& by that means is heavy, and the tin stem which is delicate
<lb />will not be able to hold it up without soon breaking, one makes the
<lb />stems with latten wire & then one solders & joins
<lb />them.

<ab>
<lb />Molding a rose
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because the little branches of the rose bush
<lb />which are <-aupart-> around the flower are sometimes
<lb />very spread out & would make too large a mold, one makes
<lb />and molds them separately, and the rose & some [<-e->]
<lb />buds separately. And then one joins with solder the little
<lb />branches & leaves of the rose bush to the stem of the
<lb />rose on which one intentionally leaves the little tips of the
<lb />small branches. Put your leaf or rose as low as you can in the
<lb />mold because the sand always raises it up. You
<lb /><-en-> can also mold several petals together, once
<lb />arranged one on top of the other, separating them with threads,
<lb />as is said. And regarding the rose, you can give a thin layer
<lb />of melted butter on the back of the petal, <-of-> on
<lb />the first petals on the outside, not on those on the inside
<lb /><-be->, to fortify it & give it the strength to
<lb />withstand, in order that the tempered sand does not spread out &
<lb />expand more than it should. You <-them-> can also mold well
<lb />the leaves of rose bushes, strawberry plants, &
<lb />similar things that are flat & can be flattened without spoiling
<lb />them with two gates, for opening your mold when it is reheated,
<lb />& cleaning the ashes from it, <-All-> and making vents
<lb />& several gates. And this is the easiest way, but the other can also
<lb />be done. And with small veins of wax adapted & joined from leaf to
<lb />leaf, you can make gates. You can even make a vein of wax from
<lb />the back of the first petal <-until->, which will join
<lb />to the gate. All of this facilitates the cast. <-Aulcu->
<lb />The principal thing is to let your reheated molds cool down
<lb />well rather than cleaning them & blowing inside them to make the
<lb />wax come out, because when the mold is hot, the ash
<lb />holds to it as if attached. But when it is cold, it wanders and leaves
<lb />with the air or when one blows one’s breath through the small
<lb />opening. Wet the rose with eau-de-vie before putting it in the
<lb />circle of clay. Do not forget to oil the wax gate.
<lb />And when you have cast your tempered sand, blow
<lb />thoroughly until it begins to set. The rose came out
<lb />well. But because the sand finds itself mixed among the petals, make your
<lb />work soak in water for a long time in order that, shaking it in
<lb />the water, the earth is gone from it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can well give a bit of thickness at the ends of the stalks that
<lb />support the leaves, anointing them lightly underneath with melted
<lb />butter, because the leaves are large & weighty, and the stalk of
<lb />lead & tin would not have enough strength.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I would be of the opinion to mold the rose on its own with a
<lb />little of its stem close to its bud, & then to join it to a longer
<lb />one of tinned latten, because the rose in full bloom has great
<lb />volume & weight.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f309" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Rose
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Because the flower in full bloom is billowy & has its petals disordered
<lb />& turned in various ways, it does not appear beautiful if it is not
<lb />painted & also inasmuch as it has weight <-or for->
<lb />that the stem of tin, which is brittle &
<lb />delicate, would be unable to support. One molds the flower of the
<lb />rose on its own & separately, making its gate largeish in order
<lb />that it comes out <-b-> better. Then one cuts this gate
<lb />down closest to the stem of the bud, on which one grafts next &
<lb />solders a stalk of latten wire to which one also
<lb />solders the leaves. But because tin, being thus thin, is
<lb />troublesome to solder, and any leaf can be melted, and also
<lb />because the cast flowers & especially the rose are not
<lb />beautiful without being painted, one does not take pains to
<lb />solder, but one <-it-> grafts the pieces to join them
<lb />& one glues them with fish glue that has been
<lb />a little tempered & thickly melted. And in order that it imprints
<lb />better, one heats the tin work gently & at a distance, for
<lb />once cold, the glue would not take. After your flower is thus
<lb />repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with modeling wax <-esb->, which is a white wax mixed with
<lb />much well-ground ceruse or, even better, lead
<lb />white, melting it & applying it on your work with a small
<lb />hot point of iron. In this way you can repair these little
<lb />barbs that are in the middle of the rose or the holes
<lb /><-of the-> that may be in any petal. Next, you will paint your
<lb />rose according to nature. If you cast your rose in
<lb />gold or silver, you can join & solder well. And
<lb />in these same metals, when you have something delicate to join to
<lb />the flower, like a fly or something similar, fish
<lb />glue is singular for it & holds very well, fixing it with a
<lb />few small points which serve as nails. The leaves
<lb />& buds can be molded in two molds that can be opened once
<lb />reheated, but not before. Next, these said things are joined.

<lb />Molding promptly and reducing a hollow form to a relief
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You can imprint the relief of a medal in colored wax, &
<lb />you will have a hollow form, in which you can cast en noyau a relief
<lb />of your sand, on which you will make a hollow form of lead
<lb />or tin, in which you will cast a wax relief. And then on
<lb />that wax you will make your mold
<lb />en noyau hollow, to cast there the relief of gold &
<lb />silver or any other metal you like. But to hasten your
<lb />work if you are in a hurry, make the first imprint & hollow form in
<lb />bread pith, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly.
<lb />And into that, cast in melted wax, which will give you a beautiful
<lb />relief on which you will make your noyau.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Very light and hollow work of gold
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cast a lizard or any medal you like in base silver,
<lb />like billon. Next, gild it lightly. And once the first
<lb />gilding is done & dried by fire, brighten, rub with a
<lb />scratch-brush, & make another layer of light gilding
<lb />like the first time, & do thus three or four times or more,
<lb />according to the thickness you want to give. And then, having made a
<lb />small hole in the least visible place, put your work into good
<lb />aquafortis, which penetrating to the silver through the hole
<lb />will eat it all away without damaging the gold, so that you will
<lb />have a lizard hollow to its nails, or any other work, so light
<lb />that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to make the layer
<lb />of amalgamated gold all at once, or of hardly any thickness each
<lb />time, because that would block the small features, but proceeding
<lb />therein as said, lightly & several times, and cleaning
<lb />well, you will do well.

<lb />In order for the aquafortis to eat away better, it is necessary

<lb />with the ordinary engraving burin the broader ones, and with
<lb />the chaple you remove the big flashing, and with the

<lb />Molding a fly
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take the largest <-vo-> flies that go into
<lb />pantries, which are not hairy, if it is possible. If they
<lb />are, anoint lightly their down & capricious hair with
<lb />olive oil to lay it down. Also take them and use them as
<lb />soon as you can after they are dead, because if you were to leave them
<lb />to dry a lot, their <-e-> legs would break when you
<lb />want to spread them out. One needs also, to make them come out
<lb />better, to place them on something like a leaf, or similar thing, to
<lb />help the casting of their little legs, which are so frangible that, by
<lb />themselves, they would not come out well in the cast. They can be
<lb />planted on a sage leaf or similar. They are cast well in
<lb />silver & gold, but one usually makes the legs &
<lb />wings separately & one reattaches them. I have molded one on a
<lb /><-e-> <-sage leaf-> bouquet of
<lb />sage, which had seven or eight leaves. And to make its stance
<lb /><-att->, I fixed its legs <-to the-> on the
<lb />widest leaf with a little wax, melted & reattached with a
<lb />hot iron wire point. And in order that the wings come
<lb />out better, I anointed the underside of these with melted butter
<lb />with a little paintbrush. And with the same hot
<lb />iron wire point, I anointed the legs & feet with
<lb />wheat oil. And to lay down & couch the
<lb />downy hair that it had, I anointed it also
<lb /><-u-> with a little olive oil.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />I did not leave the wheat oil to dry a lot, because
<lb />it is thick & has body, & the eau-de-vie does not take at
<lb />all.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For unction, <-a-> tallow is too harsh,
<lb />pork fat is too soft, and butter is the most
<lb />excellent because it is soon dry & curdled & melted quickly
<lb />& firmer. Take heed that the legs & feet are well set on the
<lb />leaf & not outside it, for that which exceeds would not come out
<lb />well, especially in silver because this <-would exceed
<lb />the->, so fine, would be of no help in the casting. And,
<lb />in truth, the feet which had been laid on the leaf came out well, but
<lb />those which straddled from leaf to leaf & remained in the void did
<lb />not come out in tin. The rest of the fly came out well,
<lb />and especially the bouquet of sage, which is very beautiful molded.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One could even cast it in gold & silver, without the
<lb />feet & without applying it on a flower, by making the gate under the
<lb />belly & reattaching with solder the feet &, if need be,
<lb />the wings with the same metal, & it could be enamelled
<lb />by fortifying the wings a little, & the feet, as said.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If your sage or branch has something to repair, do as said
<lb />below. And then paint according to nature.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once cast in gold, one enamels the wings with window
<lb />glass from Lorraine, which is verdesin and
<lb />transparent.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to make the gate for the fly from the bottom <-in
<lb />order-> with melted wax, adapted with the iron
<lb />point, as you know, to which the fly attaches itself,
<lb />& then the wax, while melting, serves as a gate for the
<lb />fly.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />+
<lb />If some flaw happens to the wings of your fly, beat some
<lb />tin very thin, <-&->or some gold or
<lb />silver if you have cast it in it, & <-with-> trim
<lb />with some scissors what one needs to reattach there, &
<lb />next, apply it with your small pincers & glue it
<lb />with fish glue, prepared as put below. And before, heat
<lb />lightly your work, in order that its coldness does not refuse the
<lb />glue, which will be soon dry, heating it from afar.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />    
<lb />Next, cover
<lb />lightly the joints of the reattached thing with some modeling
<lb />wax, which is white wax mixed with a lot of
<lb />ceruse or lead white, melting it well with a hot
<lb />iron point. You will also cut some small bits of
<lb />spinet strings & glue with the said
<lb />glue, & once dry, that is to say the feet, repair with this.
<lb />You will thicken them with the same melted wax, to render them
<lb />equal.

<lb />Molding a bird
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side

<lb />said bird, in order that it only shows one leg
<lb />& one foot, then you will anoint it with butter to make it
<lb />hold the feathers down, finally <-of oil->
<lb />eau-de-vie. And then cast. And being set, clean &
<lb />uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But
<lb />because the feet, being of bone that is difficult to burn & which
<lb />are not able to be cleaned neither by quicksilver
<lb /><-If-> nor by any other means, if the mold would not
<lb />open, uncover the bottom of the feet & the toe or the little finger
<lb />of the claw, & mold as a separate piece. Reheat & open your
<lb />mold & clean the bones. The feet usually remain too
<lb />weak to support the mass of a solid bird. And for this reason,
<lb />one adapts an iron wire in the mold of the
<lb />feet which passes into the body before casting; thus, they are
<lb />reinforced. Some mold the wings in a frame. Others mold the

<lb />Mercury in the molds for cleaning
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Heed well that your mold be quite cold before blowing to make
<lb />the ash go out, and next put in the ☿ to
<lb />achieve the cleaning. For if the mold is hot, the
<lb />☿ penetrates within &, in flight, seeks out
<lb />conduits & leaves an odor of itself, which sours the
<lb />tin or other metal that you will cast there so much that
<lb />it will break if it touches it even slightly. The heat of the
<lb />mold also retains small grains of ☿
<lb />that make lumps, & contracting to the edge of the molded leaves, are
<lb />joined there & make the leaves frangible. The
<lb />☿ cleans the ash well, especially flat
<lb />things where there are not delicate lineaments which could be broken by its
<lb />weight. And thus, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, do not
<lb />use it. But if it is necessary to use it, mix your sand with
<lb />crocum in order that it withstands the fire well.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />And after having put in the ☿, evacuate it, turning
<lb />the mouth of the mold downwards. Next, reheat the
<lb />mold gently in order that the ☿ be gone
<lb />from everywhere. In this way I have cast a branch of
<lb />periwinkle, leaves & flowers, very neatly, having given to the
<lb />flower a layer of melted butter on the back of the flower with a paintbrush.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Reheat the mold very red before <-q-> casting in it, in
<lb />order that the ☿ exhales well.

<lb />Colors for green leaves
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One usually paints them in oil, because distemper
<lb />colors have no hold. For marigold flowers, lightly ground
<lb />minium for some, & for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
<lb />massicot with it. For green, the verdigris has depth &
<lb />is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
<lb />verdigris a little yellow ocher & stil de grain
<lb />yellow. If the green is dark, put with it charcoal of peach
<lb />tree pits, which makes a <-v-> greenish black, in the
<lb />same way that black of ox foot bone looks bluish. And
<lb />thus, by judgment & discretion, put the color on the natural
<lb />flower or leaf to see whether it comes close. But layer it
<lb />transparently, so as not to cover the lines of the work.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Large molds

<lb />It makes it come out neater, & even if it is a little
<lb />thick, it does not hold to any place because it has no body. I have thus
<lb />fumigated my noyau molds for tin &
<lb />lead, and have cast in the cold mold, well dried
<lb />beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true that lead mixed
<lb />with half of tin was very hot, because the medal was thick.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Gate
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /><-Even though-> If the medal is very thick, for
<lb />this reason do not give it as thick a gate. It suffices for the gate
<lb />to have half of its thickness. But if it is thin,
<lb />give it a gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate
<lb />where typically the material becomes porous.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Never forget to oil the wax gate when you mold plants
<lb />or flowers, otherwise it breaks & cannot be taken out.

<lb />Wax portraits
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If they are painted with colors on the wax, & if the
<lb />wax is not [<-en->] tinted & mixed with color within, the color lifts
<lb />off & is undone if you mold them en noyau, but the portrait
<lb />is not spoiled. One needs to oil them lightly, bathing in
<lb />eau-de-vie & tempering with hot water. If they are
<lb />varnished, one needs to mold them two or three times to lift off the
<lb />varnish, which sticks to the mold. After it is removed,
<lb />you will be able to mold nealy. If they are on wood, one needs to
<lb />saturate the wood with very hot melted wax, for otherwise the
<lb />mold would be attached to it. Lead white is much better
<lb />for mixing with white wax than ceruse, for lead
<lb />white is firmer & whiter.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Chiseling
</ab>

<ab>
<lb />Beat it very fine & thin on a well-cleaned anvil, &

<lb />is not strong & thick enough, add some. And take heed
<lb /><-them-> not to put it to melt in a fatty vessel, but in
<lb />a new one, if you can. It is melted on the fire & is also dried
<lb />quickly on the fire, but it may be warmed from a distance once on the
<lb />work. It holds strongly. With it one joins flowers & delicate things
<lb />of gold, of silver, of tin & other materials,
<lb />which are in danger of spoiling if soldered.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Tin and lead
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />They are beaten very thin <-without se->. And the tin
<lb />does not sour & crack as lead often does,

<lb />for the most secure way, even if you could mold them together in a closed

<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make the two sides so that they are, <-es-> if it is

<lb />can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be
<lb />burned <-you->, like crayfish, you cannot open it to
<lb />clean it, & make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they
<lb />are reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for
<lb />they are rendered musty & humid, & the mold is undone
<lb />& loses its strength.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The part where the back of the animal is is usually thicker.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster alone
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Reheated stone plaster <-fears-> is undone in
<lb />water, but that which is <-reheated &-> first
<lb />pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good, it
<lb />hardens in it, like the one of Paris &
<lb />Spain, which is hard in stone, as is that which
<lb />grows in lean & dry earth and which seems like 
<lb />white salt. Germans make statues for their fountains
<lb />with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it hardens in water. When it is alone & not mixed, it sets more quickly than otherwise. One needs to oil very lightly
<lb />your molds that are of metal or stone, otherwise it would
<lb />not release. And however you oil, you have to temper it with hot
<lb />water. And when it has set & well cooled, one
<lb />needs to wet it sometimes in cold water, but if it refuses to
<lb />open, in hot water & sometimes in boiling water.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sometimes one even needs to make the mold boil in hot
<lb />water, as when you have molded some wax that you fear would
<lb />not be easily released from it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Cold water makes oil withdraw to the surface of the
<lb />plaster that has sucked it in, & thus it releases.

<lb />sieve. Next, put it in a neat, adequate dish
<lb />or semal or vessel, and wet it with clear
<lb />water, and grind it & stir with a thick stick until it
<lb />is well wetted & washed & the filth goes to the
<lb />surface of the water, & continue to stir it thus, like the
<lb />gip mat that one prepares to gild with burnished
<lb />gold, five or six days, until it is not at all
<lb />lumpy. <-# nota-> And, each time that
<lb />you stir it again, leave it to rest & empty the clear water
<lb />which will be on top by tilting or with a bowl or
<lb />sponge, and put some clear water back in, & thus
<lb />wash & stir it until it is well fine & purged of all
<lb />filth. Nota # Next, leave it a little
<lb />to drain and dry, and make from it some little balls tempered
<lb />in sal ammoniac water, and once thus <-d-> dried
<lb /><-l->, put them to reheat at great heat in a reverberatory
<lb />furnace, where they should be be quite red, a good space of
<lb />time. Once they are reheated in this way, pulverize them & try
<lb />to mold something in a frame, having moistened your
<lb />powder with sal ammoniac water. And reheat & redden the
<lb />frame, & if your sand retracts, one needs to pulverize

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />does retract from the frame when you redden it. The main thing

<lb />To mold it, it is better to spread the toes & nails out well on

<lb />Molds of things that do not release

<ab>
<lb />Animals that do not release can only be molded in two

<lb />reheated & the enclosed animal is well burned. Animals that have
<lb />bones or scales, which do not reduce into powder but rather remain as
<lb />calcined lumps, will never leave through the gate, whatever blowing
<lb />one does or whatever quicksilver one puts there, or a
<lb />feather quill during molding to use as a gate. This is why one
<lb />molds in two halves, in order that, the mold being opened after
<lb />having been reheated, the burned thing can be cleaned out well. But take
<lb />heed to let it cool well, in order that, when removing the
<lb />clamps, being hot, and when it is most frangible, something
<lb />does not break. The crust & ashes that it leaves &
<lb />which adhere to the mold while it is hot are removed better
<lb />once cold. Note also that on the bottom side of the mold, when
<lb />you reheat, the animal which boils leaves some filth. And, on
<lb />this occasion, one always marks the mold where the back of the
<lb />animal is, in order that, when reheating, it is above & on top &
<lb />that through this means it is neater.

<lb />onglet, or with that which one calls
<lb />chaple, or some small file. But above all,
<lb />avoid touching your work, but only the flashing or the lump that will have
<lb />occurred during the cast. And while repairing, wet & rub with your
<lb />very small hog bristle brushes.

<lb />Gate
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a snake,
<lb />make it come from the side of the belly & under the tail, for from
<lb />the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
<lb />repair than the back, which is more visible & more marked.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Repairing flashing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having gently removed it with the point of a chaple or
<lb />burin, scrape it with the side of the burin, or gently
<lb />with a small file, & rub with willow
<lb />charcoal & little brushes. Make continuous the lines
<lb />disturbed by the flashing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Leady silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It degrades a lot, because the lead which is mixed in works it
<lb />like in the cupel, and makes it jump in little balls at the
<lb />edges of the crucible & on the charcoal which
<lb />covers it. It is also fatty, and thus it is good to melt all coined
<lb />silver, like reals & others, & to put it in ingots
<lb />before melting it for casting lizards & animals, for it
<lb />comes out better. I molded some as neat as the principal, such as a
<lb />little viper of silver, and I made the alloy out of 4
<lb />reals, of 20 sous from
<lb />Spain, & a coin of xx
<lb />sous from France.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Blowing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When you melt silver & gold, do not blow strongly
<lb />& with violence, because with the charcoal
<lb />consolidating, the crucible would lower &
<lb /><-l'arg-> could fall over. But when your mold is
<lb />ready, at that moment, blow strongly to heat well the silver or
<lb />gold. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with
<lb />small bellows, especially gold, for this removes their
<lb />fumes & softens them.
</ab>
<ab>

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For those <-which-> in which one needs to burn something and
<lb />which do not open before being reheated, one does not make any casts
<lb />before it is reheated. For large molds in which the gate is big
<lb />and ample, it is necessary that the gate be well notched &
<lb />scratched, in order that the weight of the metal does not go with
<lb />much force. They make hardly any flashing if they are pressed. But before
<lb />pressing them, put between them and the press some pieces
<lb />of plump & thick felt, which is hardly yet crushed, for it fills the concavities & keeps the mold from
<lb />cracking. The clamps should be placed before reheating or
<lb />drying it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When the earth from which you make the earthen
<lb />slab to arrange your animal is too soft, the points that
<lb />you put in it come out easily & come undone when you cast in the
<lb />sand, & thus the mold spoils and the shape comes undone.
<lb />Therefore, when you recognize that your slab will be too tender & soft, spread on top some hot ashes & blow with
<lb />the bellows.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sand
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If there is not enough good feather alum or
<lb />crocum, it will easily crack in the fire. But if it is
<lb />mixed with it, as it should be, it withstands it. It is recognized to be
<lb />good when, being hot after the cast, it quickly imbibes water
<lb />when one quenches it & <-rends-> breaks
<lb />easily because the alum & the crocum render
<lb />it spongy. On the contrary, bad sand, which is only of plaster &
<lb />brick, & little mixed with alum, breaks easily in the
<lb />fire & hardens in water. Cast, if possible, all in one
<lb />go.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Even though you cast in lead, the molds want to be well
<lb />dried, especially when they are large, and one needs to redden them on
<lb />the outside & keep them in continuous heat until they no longer
<lb />smoke from inside. Do not place them to reheat at different
<lb />times, but continue once you have started. And do not place them
<lb />to cool in the cold, <-With-> for they would crack,
<lb />but leave them to become lukewarm near the fire, & when they are still of such a heat as you have noticed before by putting
<lb />your finger in the hole, cast. And when the
<lb />mold is large, it needs more time to reheat & dry, & one
<lb />needs to cast hotter.

<lb />If in your cast there occurs some little hole, mend it with
<lb />gummed modeling wax that is black or gray.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lake
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If, once it is ground, you let it dry without keeping it in
<lb />water, it will dry out & you will have as much trouble
<lb />grinding it as before. <-La->
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Stretching a canvas picture
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If it is crumpled & creased from being rolled up, moisten it
<lb />from behind with a wet sponge, & you will stretch it very
<lb />evenly without spoiling it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Plaster for molding
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When it is long to set & dry, it is a sign that it is too fatty
<lb />& humid, which is what makes it contract in fire & crack,
<lb />causing flashing. That which is drawn from lean soil is the best.
<lb />Molds of fatty plaster ought not to be kept for a long
<lb />time, for they act like fatty earth, which when drying by itself,
<lb />cracks. It is best to reheat them
<lb />soon after they are made, &
<lb />to cast. Good plaster keeps
<lb />a long time in
<lb />molds.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It needs to be well oiled, for it is more difficult to separate
<lb />the two halves of the molds than when it is mixed.

<lb />Dragon’s blood

<lb />Repairing snakes and lizards
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />You could well make some puncheons according to the form of
<lb />their scales, & making some bigger & some smaller, according to
<lb />the shape of the neck, the body, & the tail. If there is something
<lb />broken, you can graft it on with small <-pieces-> points of
<lb />iron or steel wire, & glue with fish
<lb />glue, & then cover it all with gray or black wax. But it
<lb />is necessary to let the glue dry for one day
<lb />without touching it.

<lb />Stance of animals
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Not only with iron points but with melted
<lb />wax, animals are secured on the earthen slab.
<lb />Wash them first in clear water, once they have died in the mixture
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />of vinegar & urine,
<lb />& with a sponge
<lb />purge their mouth,
<lb />eyes,
<lb />and the
<lb />head of
<lb />the slaver
<lb />which
<lb />comes out,
<lb />for
<lb />the sand
<lb />would never
<lb />set well
<lb />there and
<lb />would become
<lb />lumpy.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of
<lb />spinet string, which will not take up space.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Keeping animals
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
<lb />put them back into the mixture of urine, vinegar
<lb />& eau-de-vie where you killed the others, and they will keep
<lb />for a long time without spoiling. If you have a cut on your hand,
<lb />take care that this mixture does not touch it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Once molded, do not keep them for a long time, but rather use them
<lb /><-u-> as soon as you can, because when kept a long time,
<lb />they are subject to corrupting.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When they are reheated, the thing comes out better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Lute
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When reheating, you can use common lute. But when you want to
<lb />cast, strip the mold of it & promptly, with a
<lb />brush, layer the lute of plaster that has been used for
<lb />molds, for it will be dry when it is placed, & cast.
<lb />One needs to mainly put this lute on the joints.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Silver
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />When it quivers once melted, it is a sign that it is quite
<lb />hot, & because usually it is leady, it is good to throw in it
<lb />some lime mortar, for this attracts & gathers the
<lb />lead.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Fly wing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In order that they come out better, put from the gate to the edges
<lb />of these some veins of wax. Make sure also that under the belly
<lb />there is enough wax, for this is what makes the gate.

<lb />Petards
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Petards are made of the best alloy of metal & fine
<lb />rosette that one can, in order that they do not burst,
<lb />namely one part of metal & two of fine
<lb />rosette or old cauldron, which is even better. Some
<lb />are of fifteen or seventeen lb & <-ch-> are
<lb />loaded with two & a half lb of good grain
<lb />powder, & they are for applying on windows & common doors.
<lb />Others are of the weight of 25 to 27 lb and are loaded with 4
<lb />lb of powder. Others weigh 45 lb & are
<lb />loaded with eight lb of powder. And thus they are formed
<lb />according to the effort they have to make. On the outside, they are <-e->
<lb />of a regular shape, but on the inside, they are made like a
<lb />crucible, 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> narrower on the inside of the breech & becoming wider
<lb />toward the mouth. And this is to give force to the breech, because of
<lb />the quantity of powder they hold, & so that they do not
<lb />burst. <-At the breech one gives them-> Those of 45 lb
<lb />have a thickness of eight lines at the breech & become
<lb />thinner on the inside toward the muzzle, which is of 4 lines.
<lb />They are xii thumbs breadth long & seven in diameter at
<lb />the muzzle & opening.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f333" />
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Those of 27 lb or thereabouts are ix inches long & six in
<lb />diameter at the muzzle. At the breech, they are vi lines thick,
<lb />& 3 at the muzzle. The ones weighing 17 lb are 8
<lb />inches long & five at the muzzle. One covers them all
<lb />together, all the forks & pegs &
<lb />tools which one uses, with a thick canvas or thick
<lb />cloth in order that they do not make any noise. It
<lb /><-s-> is good that they should sit loaded for some time.
<lb />After one has put the powder in, one tamps it down quite
<lb />thoroughly, and then one puts in pressed paper, then a 
<lb />cake of wax 
<lb />well tamped down, & on the wax another plate of
<lb />cork that goes in quite precisely & with force. In this way,
<lb />the powder remains well sealed & gives much greater violence,
<lb />& if you wish, you can put on the plate of cork one of
<lb />wood pierced in the middle, if the petard is pierced at the
<lb />breech, which one holds to be the easiest, & which makes for greater
<lb />penetration because it cannot recoil. And for those that have a pierced
<lb />breech, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole in
<lb />order that the peg, which is made <-in-> with a
<lb />gimlet-like point, may attach the petard faster & without
<lb />noise. And <-to-> for these, one must cover the button, which is
<lb />quite evenly filed, <-p-> with waxed canvas, or
<lb />add wax to it in order that it precisely plugs the hole of the
<lb />breech. But because the doors are sometimes iron-clad & the
<lb />iron pegs cannot pierce it, one uses an iron
<lb />fork made like pincers & another iron rod
<lb /><-q-> made with three claws at the end, as you see
<lb />depicted. And in this way, the petard holds itself well & is quickly
<lb />placed. The iron pegs must extend from the petard with
<lb />the entire point that is made like a gimlet, namely by three or
<lb />4 fingers, which goes entirely <-l->
<lb />into the door. When the petards are placed, one fills the touch-hole
<lb />with good pulverin and
<lb /><-s-> one puts in it a feather quill filled with
<lb />powder tightly pressed & moistened with vinegar, or,
<lb />if needed, one presses the powder in the hollow of the hand &
<lb />having wetted it with saliva, one makes from it
<lb />something like a cocoon or

<lb />a peg which one puts into the touch-hole, & then, with
<lb />a rope wrapped around the end of a stick, one gives fire &
<lb />promptly retreats to take cover. The small petards of 16 or 17
<lb />lb are attached promptly with a short hooked peg made
<lb />like a wimble, & if the petard
<lb />is of a good alloy, one can give fire by hand just as one does
<lb />with petards of 27 lb, but then one only puts in three
<lb />lb of powder. It must certainly be a strong door if the
<lb />seventeen lb petard does not blow it up. Some use little
<lb />bells worn by oxen or mules on a
<lb />peasant door. Others load two pistol barrels &, with a
<lb />gimlet & a string, attach them with the muzzle
<lb />against the door. If the petards are good & do not explode, they
<lb />only recoil and cannot do harm if one is next to them.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />A. This is a small peg, hooked like the hinge of a door

<lb />B. This is a small petard with ears.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />C. This is a <-gro-> common petard of 27 or 30 lb

<lb />passes, button-like on one end & made like a
<lb />gimlet at the point, for quickly attaching the petard
<lb />against a door that <-does not have-> is not
<lb />covered with iron plates.

<lb />for loading the petard & sealing the powder well.

<lb />E. <-This-> Iron fork made in the form of pincers
<lb />of the height of a man, to quickly place the mortar
<lb />without a peg. It must be of soft iron in order
<lb />that its branches bend easily, if need be, to fit to the height or width
<lb />of the door.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />F. This is another iron fork of the same height that

<lb />before, & in the plaster cast in wax, from which will
<lb />come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
<lb /><-b-> model it as you fancy. And then you will model
<lb />this relief of wax again in plaster, or better yet, with
<lb />your wetted sand # like for noyau, & in the
<lb />latter, cast in some lead, & from this you will have a very
<lb />neat relief, & if it is not, repair on the cement or
<lb />otherwise, & take heed that it is always of good release. And
<lb />this one will always serve you well for making as many hollow forms as you
<lb />please, in this way. Place half of your figure of
<lb />lead, oiled & wetted with eau-de-vie according
<lb />to the above, in the clay slab, then mold this half with
<lb />some white plaster. Having set <-Next-> and having
<lb />well smoothed & flattened the plaster, take your
<lb />black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said, because it leaves
<lb />nothing in the mold & melts quicker. Wet it in warm
<lb />urine, & once softened enough, make an imprint with it
<lb />on the half of the lead figure, and <-it-> you will have a
<lb />very neat hollow form. Shape next the hollow wax form in a square shape, as
<lb />you please, with sufficient thickness & smooth it well on all sides,
<lb />& <-thus-> next, mold this hollowed wax,
<lb />imprinted on one part & flat & smooth on the other, in the same
<lb />fashion that you mold flat medals of wax or <-other->
<lb />metal en noyau. And the mold en noyau
<lb />will render in silver or such metal as pleases you
<lb /><-the m-> a similar figure to the wax, that is to
<lb />say flat & smooth on one side & hollow on the other. And having
<lb />cleaned & put this hollow form to be whitened, if it is silver,
<lb />you will be able to mix there some works of sugar,

<lb />One makes the relief puncheons of untempered steel,

<lb />Casting

<lb />Do not cast in one go, for in doing so, the metal is

<lb />Cleaning closed molds
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
<lb />for when hot, they retain the ash. When cold, they are cleaned better. Take a thin wire of latten or a delicate straw to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the gate. Blow into it & suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
<lb />thicken the tail with wax, then cut it,

<lb />        In the year fifteen hundred
<lb />            seventy-eight, the second of July, the heirs of 
<lb />            the <-e-> late Sieur
<lb />                Ouvryer received <-two hundred and five
<lb />                    écus-> the rent of Saint-Frajou, amounting
<lb />            to twelve hundred and thirty livres.
<lb />        
<lb />        They have also received, as part of the revenue of the year fifteen
<lb />            hundred seventy nine, <-two-> three hundred forty three and one third écus <-on qu->.
<lb />        
<lb />        And for the first year, eighty livres and fifteen
<lb />             remain to them,
<lb />            and for the second settlement, they have not yet received anything.

<lb />        Take, against pestilential fever or poison or plague, an

<lb />            or thoroughly tempered wine, if one is afflicted. After taking
<lb />            it, one needs to make oneself sweat.
